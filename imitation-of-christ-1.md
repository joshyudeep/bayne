### Chapter 1

_Introduction_

On the imitation of Christ, and on contempt of the world and all its vanities

“He that follows me shall not walk in darkness” (John 8:12). These are the words of Christ, and they teach us that we must imitate His life and character if we seek true illumination and deliverance from all blindness of heart. Therefore, may we make contemplating and meditating on the life of Jesus Christ our most earnest study.

Christ’s teaching surpasses all the teaching of the saints (holy men), and only those who have His Spirit find the hidden manna in His words (John 16:3; Revelations 2:17). Indeed, there are many who, though they often hear the Gospel (Christ’s words), feel very little hunger for it and gain very little benefit from it, because they do not have the Spirit of Christ.

If you desire to fully understand the words of Christ and how to wisely apply them, you must strive to conform your whole life to the teachings, mind, and likeness of Christ.

How does it profit you spiritually to have sufficient knowledge to participate in deep, theological discussions concerning the Holy Trinity if you lack humility, and as a result are displeasing to the Trinity? Do not be deceived, it is not spiritually sounding words that make you holy and pleasing to the Lord, but a godly life. Indeed, I would rather feel contrition (have a broken and contrite heart, a sense of shame, and fear of judgment) over sin than be skillful in explaining and expounding the holy scriptures.

Assuming you knew the whole Bible and were well versed in all the differing theologies, how would it profit you eternally if you did not have the love and grace of God emanating from your life (I Corinthians 13:2)? Vanity of vanities, all is futile and worthless, save to love God and to serve Him only (Ecclesiastes 1:2). Therefore, there is no wisdom greater then this – to turn our backs on the world and to reach forward to the heavenly kingdom.

It is vanity to seek after and to trust in the riches that shall perish. It is futile and worthless to covet the praise of men, and to pursue positions of importance. It is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh, or to be led by our feelings, for doing so only brings misery in the end. It is futile and worthless to desire a long life, and to have little care for a godly life. It is vanity to focus your attention on life here and now, and neglect preparing for the things which shall be hereafter. It is futile and worthless to love that which quickly passes away, and not to love and embrace those things that bring us into eternal joy.

Think often (meditate) on this saying, “The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing” (Ecclesiastes 1:8). Therefore, devote yourself to turning your heart away from the love of the things that are seen, and to set it upon the things that are not seen (Colossians 3:1-3). For those who follow after their own fleshly lusts defile the conscience and waste the grace of God.

### Chapter 2

_On thinking humbly of oneself_

There is naturally in everyone a desire for knowledge and understanding (Ecclesiastes 1:13), yet without a fear of God that compels you to live a godly life, knowledge remains spiritually unprofitable. Therefore, it is better to be a lowly peasant who fears and obeys God than a well educated theologian who proudly expounds on the scriptures yet fails to live up to what he knows. Such a person neglects to honestly evaluate himself according to the truth he knows.

The one who honestly evaluates himself is vile in his own sight, and he doesn’t allow the praises of men to deceive him into thinking otherwise.

If you know all there is to know in this world, yet do not love as God says to love, how will your knowledge help you before God, who is going to judge you according to your deeds? Therefore, run from an inordinate desire for knowledge, for such a pursuit leads to being distracted from what really matters, and it nurtures the disease of self-deception.

Those who have knowledge want to be seen as well educated, and they want to be respected for their wisdom. However, many of the things people gain knowledge of, are of little or no profit to their spiritual well-being. Therefore, to avoid being foolish, devote yourself to both gaining and applying the knowledge of things that promote your spiritual health.

Expounding on how much you know never permanently satisfies your longing for the praise of others any more than a good meal permanently satisfies hunger. However, a godly life brings inward peace, a calming contentment, and a renewal of your mind (Philippians 4:6-7; Romans 12:2). And a pure conscience gives you good reason to have great confidence when coming into the presence of God (Hebrews 10:19-22).

The greater and more thorough your knowledge of God and His word, the more severely you will be judged – unless you have applied what you know to your own life (Luke 12:48b). Therefore do not think highly of yourself because of any spiritual gift or theological education or Bible knowledge you may have, but rather fear the judgment of God for not having lived up to what you know.

If you think of yourself as knowing many things and understanding them well, know also that there are many more things which you do not know. Therefore, do not be haughty or even modestly proud of what you do know. Rather, be open, honest, and therefore humble concerning all you do not know (Romans 12:16).

It is foolish pride that prompts you to crave being seen as more knowledgeable than another. Such a craving is especially foolish and prideful since there are many who are more learned and more skilled in explaining the Scripture than you.

If you want to acquire the kind of knowledge and learning that is spiritually profitable, you must live up to what you know, you must love being unknown, and you must want to be counted as nothing.

When it comes to humility, you have learned the highest and most profitable lesson when you truly judge yourself less than others. To think of yourself as nothing – as having less importance than others, and to think always kindly and highly of others – this is godly wisdom and Christ-like perfection. Even if you see your neighbor sin openly or grievously, you ought not to think of yourself as better than he, for you do not know how long you can keep from sinning. All of us are weak and frail (Genesis 8:21). Therefore, with sincerity of mind, hold no one more weak and frail then yourself.

### Chapter 3

_On the knowledge of truth_

Happy is the man who is taught by Truth himself, not in parables and catchy phrases that are hard to define, but in a clear and straightforward manner (Psalm 94:12; Numbers 12:8). Sadly, left to our own opinions, feelings, and perceptions concerning God and His truth, we are easily led astray – discerning but little of the truth.

What does it profit to debate and discuss the hidden things and the mysteries of scripture when God will not even reprove us on Judgment Day for failing to know them? What foolishness, what senselessness to neglect the things which are clearly profitable and necessary for godliness while giving our minds to things which are curious and of little value, even if we gain a clear understanding of them! As the scripture says, such a person has eyes, but they cannot see (Psalm 115:5).

Have nothing to do with discussions about the origin of the world or other topics the scripture have already answered (Hebrews 11:3)! Those who read and believe the Eternal Word are free from such unfruitful speculation and conjecture. From this One Word are all things, and all things speak of Him. This is the Beginning which also speaks unto us (John 8:25).

Everyone who lacks faith in Jesus and fails to live according to His word, understands or rightly judges anything spiritual. However, the one who makes Christ his all in all, who brings all things to Christ, who sees all things in Christ, who lives according to the words of Christ, and who submits to the will of Christ – he is the one whose mind is kept in perfect peace and who is at rest in God.

Prayer: “O God, You are the Truth. Make me one with You in everlasting love. I am often wearied when I read and listen to many things. You and Your truth are all that I wish for and desire. Let all the Doctors of Divinity and Bible scholars hold their peace. Let all creation keep silence. You, alone, speak to me.”

The more a man is one with God in purity and simplicity, the more things and the deeper things of God’s he understands – and that without laboring over them because he receives the light of understanding from above (Psalm 119:97-100). When the spirit of a man is pure, sincere, and steadfast (faithful), it is not distracted from what matters most even though it has many duties to perform throughout the day. Why? Because it does all things to the honor of God and strives to be free from all thoughts of selfish self-seeking.

Where do the hindrances and annoyances come from that distract you from what matters most? Is it not your undisciplined heart? The man who hungers for righteousness and sincerely pursues godliness, prepares beforehand, within his own heart, to face the temptations and trials of the day. Therefore, he is not easily drawn away by the desires of his evil will. But having prepared in heart and mind for any attack, he remains faithful by submitting to God, resisting the devil, and drawing ever nearer to God through the use of godly thinking coming forth from a transformed mind (Romans 12:2).

Which Christian has a harder battle to fight than the one who strives to deny himself, to take up his cross day after day, and to exercise self-control over his flesh – all for the purpose of living a godly life and serving Jesus Christ (Luke 9:23-24; I Corinthians 9:24-27)? Yet in spite of the great difficulty and even weariness in battle, subduing our flesh and putting on Christ should be our unrelenting endeavor (Romans 13:12-14) so that our new nature will consistently grow stronger and our old nature will continue to dwindle and die. This is the narrow path to Christian maturity and spiritual perfection.

Keep in mind that all our perfection has some imperfection joined to it in this life, and all our power of sight is not without some darkness. Therefore, a humble view of yourself is a surer way to God than the deep searching of man's learning (Matthew 5:3). However, learning is not to be scorned, and the accumulation of knowledge about any good thing is not to be despised, for both are given to us by God. Yet a good conscience and a holy life are better than knowledge (II Timothy 2:19-20).

Sadly, because many seek knowledge while neglecting godly living, they go astray and bear little or no fruit. If only they would give the same diligence to rooting out their vices (their old nature) and planting virtue in their place (Christ-likeness) that they give to studying and debating spiritually useless questions. Then there would be far less evil behavior and stumbling-blocks among the believers, and churches would be more nearly as pure as they ought to be. Do not let anyone deceive you about this, at the Day of Judgment it will be demanded of you, not what you have read, but what you have done (Matthew 7:24-27; James 1:22-25); not how well you have spoken, but how holy you have lived (Matthew 15:7-9).

Tell me, where are all those popular speakers and teachers who spoke better than they lived? You knew them well while they were with you, and you listened attentively to what they said. Yet their pulpits are filled by others who probably never give them a second thought. While they lived they seemed to be important, but now no one speaks of them. Oh how quickly the glory of the world passes away! If only their knowledge and life, their words and deeds, had agreed together! Then they would have read and inquired and accumulated great knowledge for a good purpose.

Many perish through empty teaching in the church. We see the truth of this in that fact that many devote themselves far more to knowing the right theology and to Christian service than to holy living. And because they love to be noticed and considered important more than to be humble and holy, they "have become vain in their imaginations" (Romans 1:21).

The only one who is truly great is the one who loves God with all his heart, soul, mind, and strength, and who loves his neighbor as himself (Mark 12:29-31). The one who is truly important deems himself small, and counts the highest degrees of honor as nothing. The one who is truly wise counts all earthly things as dung that he may win Christ (Philippians 3:8). And the one who is truly learned is the one who does the will of God to the denial of his own will.

### Chapter 4

_On prudence in action_

When dealing with someone or talking about them with others, we must not trust every word that others speak, or the feelings we have within ourselves toward them (I John 4:1). Rather we ought to cautiously and patiently put their words and our feelings to the test to see how they measure up against the Word and will of God.

Sadly, we are so weak that we find it easier to believe evil and speak evil of others, rather than good. But those that are holy (godly in character, thought, word and deed) do not give unquestioning heed to every news-bearer, for they know man's weakness – that he is prone to evil and inconsistent communication.

This is great wisdom – not to speak or act hastily in response to what one person says about another, or to treat your assumptions and opinions as fact (Proverbs 18:13,17). A second part of this wisdom is not to believe every word you hear, nor to tell others all that you hear even though you believe it (Proverbs 17:9).

Take counsel with a man who is wise and of a good conscience (of godly character). Seek to be instructed by one better than yourself, rather than to follow your own ideas and strategies (Proverbs 12:15).

A holy life makes a man wise toward God and man, and gives him experience in many things (Proverbs 15:33). The more humble a man is in himself and the more obedient towards God, the wiser he will be – in all things, and the more he will experience that deep inner peace which comes from God.

### Chapter 5

_On the reading of Holy Scriptures_

It is Truth which we must look for in the Holy Scriptures, rather than cunning arguments with which to defeat those who disagree with our understanding of God’s Word (Romans 15:4). Indeed, all Scripture ought to be read with the same purpose for which it was written. [“All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.” (II Timothy 3:16-17)]. We must seek in Scripture that which is profitable for knowing God and living a holy life, rather than that which enables us to discuss its subtleties and mysteries. Do not be deceived, being able to “hold our own” when debating the scriptures or even to win useless religious discussions does not make us better Christians.

Therefore we ought to read the Scriptures more than any other book, and books about the scriptures more than any other source of reading material. Of the books that supplement our scripture reading – such as the Patristic writings (Church Fathers), commentaries, Bible dictionaries, theological works, study guides, and devotional works – we ought to read those that are simple and easy as well as those that are deep and difficult. Do not let the educational background of the writer be a stumbling-block, whether he has no degree or many degrees. Rather, let your love of the pure Truth and hunger to know God and His ways draw you to read. Do not select a book by the popularity of its author, but rather select it on the basis of his spiritual depth, his promotion of spiritual maturity, and the humility with which he presents it. Writers, teachers, theologians, and apologists pass away, but the truth of the Lord as revealed in the Holy Scriptures endures forever.

God speaks to us in various ways, without regard to who we are or what we know. You can miss what God is saying in the scriptures by allowing your curiosity over what is obscure to distract you from devoting time to what can be clearly understand. There is great wisdom in moving on to studying and pondering what you can understand rather than seek to answer every difficult question or come up with clever explanations for those hard to explain portions.

If you hope to profit by your reading, read humbly, simply, honestly, and with the intent of applying what you have not yet applied. Never read to gain the approval of others or to be held in esteem as one who is well educated in the Scriptures. Ask questions freely and listen in silence to the words of holy men. Do not be displeased at the hard sayings of those older and more spiritually mature than you, for their answers are not given without cause.

### Chapter 6

_On excessive and unrestrained affections_

When we desire anything inordinately (too much), we easily become dissatisfied with what we have and upset or even angry when we do not get what we want. This leads to the loss of contentment with God, and the loss of that deep inner peace which comes from trust in God.

The proud and the covetous are never at rest. However, those who are humble of heart and content with God, His provision, His protection, what He is doing, and what He is allowing, abide in that heavenly peace which surpasses all comprehension (Philippians 4:4-7).

Those who are not yet wholly dead to self in regard to fleshly and worldly desires, are easily tempted to self-pity, envy, frustration, and anger  – even by small and trivial matters. In fact, we weaken ourselves spiritually, thus making it hard to resist temptation and turn away from fleshly pleasures or worldly ways, when we allow our mind to dwell on unholy desires and ungodly thoughts (Philippians 4:8). And if in an effort to appear more spiritual we deny ourselves the desires of our flesh, we may look better on the outside but we won’t feel better on the inside until we put those desires to death – by the gracious enablement of God. In fact, we will feel sad, cheated, or even resentful over not being able to enjoy what we really want – which often leads to being easily angered when someone opposes what we want in another area.

And yet if we yield to temptation, our conscience will weigh us down with condemnation for having done what we know is wrong, and we will have pushed ourselves even further away from gaining the inward peace known by the godly. Indeed, true peace of heart is to be found in resisting earthly and fleshly passions, not in yielding to them. Therefore there is no peace in the heart of those who are fleshly, nor in those who give themselves up to worldly pleasures. True peace is found in the hearts of those who are fervent towards God, who treasure God, who trust in God for all their needs, and who live according to the will and word of God.

### Chapter 7

_On fleeing from vain hope and pride_

Vain – that which is futile and worthless – is the life of the one who puts his trust in men or in any created thing (Psalm 20:6-7, 33:16-19, 44:4-6; Isaiah 31:1; Jeremiah 17:5).

Do not be ashamed to be the servant of others for the love of Jesus Christ, nor to be viewed as poor or unimportant in this life.

Do not trust in your own power and ability, but nurture hope and confidence in God (Psalm 147:10-11). Do what God has given you to do – for He knows what you have the ability and power to do. As you obey Him, He will aid you.

Do not trust in your education or knowledge. Do not trust in the cleverness of anyone you know. Rather, trust in the favor of God, for He resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.

Do not boast in your riches if you have them, nor in your friends if they are powerful, but boast in God who is the giver of all good things. And in addition to giving you all good things, God longs to give you Himself.

Do not be conceited or boastful of your strength or beauty, for with only a slight sickness each will fail and wither away. Do not use your skillfulness or natural abilities to please yourself, lest you displease God who has given us every good gift which we have.

Do not count yourself better than others, lest possibly you appear worse in the sight of God, for He knows what is in man. Do not be proud of your good works, for God's judgments are of another sort than the judgments of man – and what pleases man is frequently displeasing to God.

If you have any good, believe that others have more – for in so doing you nurture humility. You do no harm to yourself by placing yourself below everyone else, but you do great harm to yourself by placing yourself above even one (James 4:6; I Peter 5:5). The inner peace of God is always with the humble, but the heart of the proud is agitated by envy and frequent irritation with others.

### Chapter 8

_On the danger of too much familiarity_

Do not expose your deepest thoughts and personal feelings to everyone. Reserve such revelations and discussions for when you are with those who are both wise and fear God. Do not spend a lot of time talking about these things with the young and with strangers.

Do not be a flatterer of the rich, nor eagerly seek to socialize with the great. Fellowship with the humble and the simple, the devout and the meek, and let your conversation be centered around things which edify. Do not get intimately involved with any woman, but commend all good women unto God. Choose God and His Son for your most intimate companions, and flee from seeking attention from those of like nature (mankind).

We must love all men, but not make close companions of all – for it is not easy to discern what is in a man’s heart. For example, sometimes we highly regard someone we scarcely know because another has spoken well of him. Yet those who know him well find him hard to deal with or unpleasant to live with, and hence do not regard him highly. Sometimes we try to impress others by our friendliness (get them to feel admiration and respect for us) only to displease or offend them as they discover the faults in our character by how we live day after day.

### Chapter 9

_On obedience and subjection_

It is truly an honorable, godly quality to live in cheerful obedience – to willingly submit to authority rather than be self-ruled. In relation to godliness, it is far safer to live in subjection – as one under authority – than to be in the place of authority. Many submit to those in authority from necessity rather than from love. Such as these are easily annoyed inwardly at being told what to do, or they openly complain over the smallest command. They will never gain freedom from their resentment and discontentment unless, for the love of God and from a humble heart, they willingly submit to those over them.

Though you search far and wide for an authority to whom you can cheerfully submit, you will not find that inner peace and contentment which comes from godly submission to whomever God has chosen or allowed to rule over you. The only way to find the inner peace of godly submission is to humbly and willingly submit to the authority who is currently over you. Thinking a change of location and hence a change of the one in authority will make all things well is a lie that has deceived many.

It is true that every one of us eagerly follows his own inclinations, beliefs, and feelings, and we like best those who agree with us. But if Christ is among us (that is, two or more are gathered in His name), then it is necessary that we sometimes yield up our own opinions for the sake of peace.

Who is so wise as to have perfect knowledge of all things? Therefore, do not trust in your own opinions to the extent that you are unwilling to consider the opinions of others.

Though your own opinion on a certain subject is good, yet if for the love of God you hold it silently and follow that of another, you will gain greater spiritual profit (personal growth and blessing from God).

It is often said that it is safer to listen and adhere to counsel, than to give it. It may also turn out that each opinion offered was worthy of serious consideration. Therefore, to refuse to listen to others when reason or occasion requires it, is a mark of pride or stubbornness.

### Chapter 10

_On the danger of too many words_

Avoid as far as you can unprofitable and unnecessary conversation. Talking about worldly things – though it be innocently undertaken – is a hindrance to godliness, because conversation that stimulates our fleshly nature ensnares and pollutes us by stirring ungodly thinking and feelings.

Many times I wish that I had held my peace, and had not entered into certain conversations. Why do we chit-chat, banter, and gossip, when afterwards – upon reflecting on what we said – it is obvious that we have fed our mind with unwholesome conversation, thus weakening both our conscience and our determination to persevere in the pursuit of godliness?

Sadly, we like conversations that require little mental effort because it is an easy and comfortable way to converse with anyone, and because it provides pleasing relief from the hard work of serious thinking. Furthermore, we are prone to talk and think about those things which we love or desire, or else about those things we most dislike. This too can be a distraction that works against a serious pursuit of God and godliness. And in the end, we are the losers – we are the ones who come away with less than we had spiritually before engaging in such conversations. For however good such talking makes us feel, it stands in the way of drawing nearer to God than we already are. It diminishes our love and devotion to God. It feeds our flesh. And it works against whatever desire we have to be further conformed to the likeness of Christ. Therefore, we must be on our guard and with frequent prayer that we do not waste time in this way. When the right and opportune time comes to speak, speak of things that edify.

Unchallenged bad habits and the neglect of preparing ourselves spiritually for each day leads to a weakened sensitivity and carelessness in guarding our lips. However, serious-minded conversations on spiritual things promote spiritual progress – especially where those of like mind and spirit make God and the things of God the basis of their fellowship.


### Chapter 11

_On seeking peace of mind and spiritual progress_

We could enjoy an abundance of peace if we would stop concerning ourselves with what others say and do, and with things that do not concern us.

How can those who concern themselves with or meddle in other people’s matters remain in a state of peace? How can those who pay too much attention to things outside themselves while paying little attention to what is going on inside, remain in a state of peace? Blessed are the single-minded – those focused on what really matters – for they shall live in abundant peace.

How is it that so many of the Saints were so spiritually mature, and so able to give themselves to thoughtful meditation and focused pondering of Divine things? Because they consistently and persistently made it their aim to die to all worldly desires. As a result they were able to free themselves of distractions as they focused their whole heart on God – contemplating and meditating on Him, His ways, and His Word.

Our problem is that we are too concerned with our own fleshly desires, whims, feelings, and perceived needs, and too anxious about temporary, passing things. Another weakness is that we rarely pursue godliness to the extent that we entirely conquer even a single fault. In addition, we lack the zeal, perseverance, and discipline required for daily growth in grace, faith, and holiness, and so we remain lukewarm and spiritually immature (Hebrews 5:11-14).

If we were vigilant and honest – moment by moment – in evaluating our spiritual condition (thoughts, desires, words, deeds) according to the Word of God and the life of Christ, and if we would put to death the lusts of our flesh and die to the attractions of the world, we would make obvious and worthy progress in working out our salvation (Philippians 2:12-13). Our greatest and most grievous stumbling-block is that we continue to cling to one or more fleshly desires and worldly affections. This pollution, this double-mindedness, this trying to love godliness and ungodliness at the same time weakens our zeal for holiness to the point that we will not make the effort necessary to walk the narrow path of the Saints. And when a little trouble comes our way, we further weaken our zeal for holiness by feeling sorry for ourselves, feeling disappointed with God, and running to the world for comfort.

If we would do the part God has given us to do in the pursuit of godliness, with courage and integrity, and if we would face the enemy with zeal and boldness, so as to stand firm in battle, we would see the Lord empowering us and helping us on to victory (Philippians 4:13). Indeed, the Lord is always ready to help those who do their part in striving against sin, and who trust in Him alone for the grace and strength necessary to be victorious (II Peter 1:2-11). In addition, He shows us and convicts us of our sin, thus giving us further opportunities to win more victories.

If we confine our progress in religion to outward observances and forms – changing our religious garb but not our heart – whatever zeal for true holiness we have will progressively weaken until it is gone. So let us lay the axe to the very root of our self-life so that we may be cleansed from fleshly desires and worldly affections, and in so doing grow in godliness and possess true peace with God. Surely, God is both able and willing to empower us for such a work.

If by the grace and power of God we put to death one fault each year and replaced it with Christ-likeness, we would make worthy progress toward Christian perfection. But sadly, the experience of many is that they were more zealous and holier after first becoming a Christian than after many years of being a Christian. Zeal and progress ought to increase day by day, yet it is all to common for Christians to think they have achieved something great if after many years they have been able to retain just a portion of the passion for God and zeal for godliness they had at first. If we would push ourselves and discipline ourselves for the purpose of growing in godliness from the start of our Christian life, then after a few years we would find that dying to self, pursuing holiness, and living for God would be much easier, more natural, and more enjoyable (I Timothy 4:7-8).

It is hard to break a habit. It is even harder to choose against your will or turn away from what you love or crave or treasure. If you are unwilling or too lazy to overcome small and easy obstacles (smaller sins and evil habits), where will you find the strength of heart and zeal to persevere in overcoming the greater ones?

Resist every temptation to exercise self-rule, and from the first moment of becoming a Christian, or at least from this day forward, begin breaking every evil habit, lest the failure to do so lead you little by little into worse evils. I am convinced that if you knew the extent of inner peace and satisfying communion with God that comes from a holy life, and if you cared about how much your willful or careless unholiness hurt God (Ezekiel 6:9), and if you had a godly concern for loving others as yourself, you would be as zealous and disciplined in the pursuit of spiritual growth as you could be.

### Chapter 12

_On the uses of adversity_

It is good that we sometimes face disappointments, troubles, trials, and tribulations, for they provide additional motivation to see ourselves as strangers and sojourners, and to live as those who do not put their trust in any worldly thing.

It is good that we sometimes experience opposition and disapproval, and face critical and unfair judgment when our intentions and deeds are good. Why? Because enduring these things in a godly manner promotes humility and discourages thinking more highly of ourselves than we ought (Romans 12:16; I Peter 3:8). Second, when others speak evil of us falsely and give us no credit for the good we have done, it can drive us all the more to make God our first and foremost source of security and approval. Indeed, we ought to make God our complete source of security and approval so that we do not feel the need to seek approval and praise – or even consolation when distressed – from those around us.

When the one who fears God is afflicted or tried or oppressed with evil thoughts, he realizes how much he needs God’s grace and strength – clearly seeing that without God’s help he is unable to continually do what he knows is right. Saddened by the wickedness of his heart, the weakness of his flesh, and the waywardness of his mind, he groans and cries out to God in prayer. Knowing he is trapped in this body of flesh, he looks forward to death so he can be free of his flesh and be with Christ – and hence become fully like Christ (I John 3:2).

Therefore, the recurring adversities without and afflictions within convince the godly that in this world there is no such thing as a trouble free life with perfect security and complete peace. The closest we can come to that is to live a life of faith in God and a life of holiness before God.

### Chapter 13

_On resisting temptation_

As long as we live in this world we will face troubles, trials, and temptation. We see this even in the life of Jesus, for at the end of His temptations in the wilderness the scripture says, “Now when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from [Jesus] until an opportune time” (Luke 4:13). Notice, the devil did not depart never to return, but to return at a later, more opportune time. Therefore, if Jesus was repeatedly tempted, we ought to be constantly on guard against trials and temptations, and vigilant in prayer, so that the devil cannot find an occasion to deceive us – for he never sleeps. He is constantly on the prowl seeking someone to devour (I Peter 5:8).

No one is so perfect in holiness and communion with God that he is no longer susceptible to temptation. Nor will we, in this life, ever be free from those occasions when our flesh or the world or the devil do their utmost to tempt us.

However, even though temptations are hard to resist and their frequent occurrence a burden to bear, they are very profitable to the godly. In experiencing them we are humbled. In resisting them we are spiritually strengthened and further purified. In enduring them we learn more about trusting God, the character of God, the ways of God, the Word of God, submitting to God, putting off the old nature, putting on the new nature, and the value of perseverance in the pursuit of godliness.

All who live godly in Christ Jesus have faced and endured many tribulations and temptations, and have received great spiritual profit as a result. On the other hand, those who continue to give in to temptation become increasing selfish and immoral in their behavior, weak in their faith, dull in their conscience, hardened in their heart, and in danger of falling away. Therefore, be strong in the Lord, for there is no home so godly, no work situation so Christian, no church position so sacred, and no spiritual retreat so secret, that it is without temptations and adversities (Ephesians 6:10).

No one is free from various temptations as long as he lives, because the propensity (inclination, desire) to sin is within us – having been born in this condition. When one temptation or trial passes, another comes – if not from the outside than from the inside (James 1:14). We will always suffer under this burden because the whole human race has fallen from God’s original state of perfection and has chosen to serve Satan and self instead of God (Genesis 3).

Many of those who have tried to be free of temptations by moving away from their current surroundings and circumstances fall more deeply after moving. Moving away, by itself, neither frees us from temptation nor empowers us to overcome temptation. What brings victory is (1) facing temptation with faith that God empowers us for victory, (2) with the power of the scriptures, (3) with adequate preparation and much prayer, (4) with self-control and endurance, (5) and with true humility (Hebrews 12:1-3; I Corinthians 10:13; II Timothy 2:22).

If your efforts to overcome temptation are confined to resisting when tempted, you will remain weak in those areas where you are easily tempted. And you will find that temptation returns quickly and frequently in those areas. Such a limited effort is of little benefit to your spiritual growth.

However, (1) if in the hours, days, and even weeks prior to being tempted you devote time to killing off and rooting out whatever it is in you that a particular temptation appeals to, (2) and if you devote sufficient time to putting on the character and values of Christ in that area, (3) and if you memorize scripture useful for following Christ’s example in resisting specific temptations and remaining on the narrow path, (4) and if you commune with God so often it is as if you are praying without ceasing, you will face temptation empowered and prepared to resist it and remain faithful to God.

Because killing off an area of your old nature and putting on Christ-likeness rarely happens in a moment of time, you will need endurance. Therefore, victory and newness of life are gained little by little, day after day, through patience and longsuffering, persistence and much prayer as you do your part in uprooting the evil in you and resisting when tempted. And though punishing your body, exercising self-discipline, and persevering in overcoming temptation is vital to gaining the victory, victory itself comes by the grace and strength of God. [God’s dealings with Israel in relation to taking the Promised Land provides an O.T. example of our sanctification, especially in terms of who does what and how long it will probably take (Exodus 23:27-30; Numbers 33:55-56; Deuteronomy 7:1-2; Joshua 23:11-13).]

When enduring a time of prolonged temptation, seek godly counsel. If others who are struggling in the face of temptation seek counsel from you, do not be harsh, heartless, or pitiless, but comfort, encourage, and strengthen them, just as you would want done to you.

Temptation gains a hold in us when we are double-minded, discontented, self-focused, and have doubts about God and His dealings with us (unbelief – Hebrews 3:12).

Just as a ship without a helm is tossed about by the waves, so the one who is careless in preparation and vigilance, and undisciplined in focus, is easily tempted in many things (Ephesians 6:11-18; II Peter 1:4-11).

As fire tests iron, so temptation tests the faith and character of the godly. We don’t always know the strength of our faith and character, but temptation reveals how strong we are.

Give careful attention to this truth: we must remain prepared and vigilant if we are to resist the devil and flee when attacked by the smaller, more socially acceptable or easily overlooked temptations. For if we do not resist the smaller temptations, it will not be long before we are giving in to the larger, more obvious temptations. In addition, it is far easier to resist the devil’s purposes and subdue our flesh in the smaller temptations than in the larger ones. Therefore, as soon as the smallest temptation knocks, we ought to meet it outside the door so that it has no opportunity to crack the door open and make way for more and greater evil to come in. It is for this reason that someone said:

>“Be on guard against the first, smallest,  
And more easily ignored temptations,  
For they are most easily cured.  
But if they are allowed to enter and find a home,  
In the face of greater temptation  
You will lack the strength to endure”

Temptation starts in the mind with a thought or simple suggestion. Next the mind imagines doing or possessing what is being suggested. This is followed by anticipation of the pleasure, fame, fortune or sense of security to be gained. Then with the desires inflamed, the craving for gratification drives consent (James 1:14-15). And so little by little the enemy enters in until he’s in altogether, because he was not resisted outside the door.

Here is a trustworthy statement: the longer you delay resisting the devil the weaker you grow and the stronger his influence grows within you until his temptations seem to strong to resist.

Some Christians experience their most severe temptations soon after conversion, some after years of being a serious minded, growing Christian. Some are sorely tested and tried the whole of their Christian life, while it seems others are only lightly tempted. Yet each is tempted according to the wisdom and love of our sovereign God, who knows the character and circumstances of each one and orders all things for the well-being of His elect (Romans 8:29).

Therefore, we ought never to despair or give in to discouragement when we are tempted. Rather, we ought to  pray to God more fervently that He will graciously help us in all our trials, testings, and tribulation. And help He will – for He never allows us to be tempted beyond our current ability to resist. And regardless of the nature or strength of the temptation, He always provides a way to escape so that we emerge victorious (I Corinthians 10:13). To this end the scriptures says: “Submit therefore to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw near to God and He will draw near to you” (James 4:7-8a). Let us therefore humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God and act according to His directives in the face of all temptation and trouble, for He will save and exalt those who are of a humble spirit.

Temptations and troubles show the strength of our faith, the quality of our character, and our progress made in being conformed to the image of Christ. In resisting them and remaining faithful to God, we gain greater eternal rewards. We display the depth of our love for God. And we show how much zeal we have for godliness.

It is not difficult, and therefore it is not exceptional, to be godly and zealous for righteousness when life is free of trials and affliction (Matthew 5:46). But if we patiently endure and remain faithful in times of adversity, we will make great spiritual progress and please our heavenly Father.

Some are kept safe from great temptations, but are overcome by those which are little and common. If this is your experience, then the lesson to be learned is not to trust in yourself in great things, seeing how weak you are in small things.

### Chapter 14

_On avoiding rash judgment_

Thoughtfully, thoroughly, and carefully examine yourself. Measure your thoughts, words, and deeds against the Holy Scriptures. Judge yourself according to what is true and just (Matthew 7:2-5; I Corinthians 11:31-32). Beware of judging others more severely than yourself, or in a manner that is reproachful, critical, and damning (Romans 2:1-4). 

There are three common, yet ungodly outcomes when you judge others in a reproachful, condemning way. First, your efforts bear no good fruit. Second, you often judge incorrectly. Third, you easily fall into the sins of arrogance and injustice. However, when you honestly examine and judge yourself, your efforts will always bear good fruit. 

Too often we judge a matter or person according to our feelings and assumptions rather than what is true. This easily and frequently leads to misjudgment. If God was the sole object of our desire, if His glory and honor mattered more to us than life itself, if drawing near to Him was driven by our longing to have Him draw near to us, we would run from judging others according to our feelings and assumptions. 

Many have an underlying impulse to seek their own ends in what they do, yet deceive themselves or live in denial about their selfish motivation. They seem to possess true peace of mind, but only so long as things go well with them. If their interests or desires are in some way frustrated or thwarted, they are immediately agitated, often distressed, and certainly unhappy. 

Diversity of feelings and differences of opinions often cause dissension and sometimes division between friends, countrymen, and even the godly. Cultural influences, established customs, and family practices are not easily relinquished. For this reason, no one is easily convinced to relinquish long held beliefs, values, and opinions for those of another. 

Therefore, if you rely more upon your own reason and experience than upon the power of Jesus Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit to lead you into truth, then your growth in understanding God and His word will be slow and slight – because God wills that we be perfectly submissive to Him and that our reasoning be made sensible through loving Him as we ought. 

### Chapter 15

_On deeds compelled by love_

Never believe that any evil can be an act of love toward anyone, or that it can produce some good – even if thought to be well intentioned. Therefore, there are times when wise discernment of a person’s values, motives, or circumstances leads us to postpone doing the good we originally intended to do for them. And there are times when discernment leads us to see that what we originally thought to be an act of love, will only serve to encourage sinful and selfish behavior in the person to whom we are wanting to do good. As a result of seeing more clearly, we change what we were intending to do to something better. Though both these acts of discernment may appear to work against love in the mind of the one in need, and in the eyes of those watching, they don’t. Rather, they improve love. 

Without godly love toward God and others as the overriding motive in serving the needs of others, our good deeds are as unprofitable to us in eternity as treasure laid up on earth. But whatever we do from love of God and man, however small and insignificant, brings blessing in this life and profit in the life to come – for God looks at what we are able to do far more than at the greatness of what we did (Luke 21:1-4; Luke 6:38; Matthew 6:19-20). 

He who loves much does much. He who seeks the greater good of others in the doing of what he does accomplishes much for those served by his deeds of love. He who seeks and serves the greater good of the community, rather than his own good, does what is pleasing to God. 

Beware of what appears to be deeds motivated by love but are really deeds motivated by selfishness. Such deeds spring from a natural inclination to serve, or from a longing for recognition, acceptance, and approval, or from hope of repayment, or from some other desire for personal gain. 

He whose heart and mind are set on loving as God loves in no way seeks his own good or glory, but trusts in God to meet his needs and longs for God, alone, to be glorified. He envies no one, neither their possessions, position, abilities, nor renown – because he craves no selfish joy and he is content with what God gives him. He does not delight in his accomplishments, but sets his heart on pleasing God in the next situation or circumstance just as he had set his heart on pleasing God in the last. He regards no one as inherently good except God – who is the Fountain from which all good flows, and who is the End, the Peace, and the Joy of all the saints. 

Therefore, he who has just a spark of godly love has come to realize that all worldly things are of no eternal value or spiritual profit.


### Chapter 16

_On bearing with the imperfections of others_

The imperfections which we have not yet been able to improve in ourselves or which continue to plague others, we ought to patiently endure, just as God patiently endures our failures as we strive to grow in Christ-likeness. Give careful consideration to the possibility that enduring imperfections is the better way, for it strengthens your determination to persevere in the pursuit of godliness, and it develops your compassion and patience with others – three qualities which add value to all other godly qualities. Therefore, when you become aware of imperfections, persevere in earnest prayer that God would give you the grace and strength to bear them with a good attitude. 

If a fellow Christian has been admonished once or twice about these kinds of imperfections and he does not listen, do not struggle or contend with him in an effort to convince him. Instead, commit all to God – waiting patiently and peacefully on Him to do His will and bring honor to His name through His servants – for He knows how to bring good out of all things (Romans 8:28). 

Endeavor to be patient in bearing with other people's imperfections and infirmities whatever they may be, for you also have many things which others must bear with. If you cannot make yourself what you desire to be, how will you make others into what you think they should be?

To our shame, we are eager to see others made perfect, and yet we do not correct our own faults. We want others to be vigorously corrected, but we get defensive or complain of unkind treatment when vigorously corrected ourselves. We get upset when others do as they please, yet we do not get upset when we cannot do as we please. We want rules made to restrain others, yet we do not want to be restrained. Sadly, we seldom judge our neighbor in the same way we judge ourselves, because we judge according to a double-standard – one for our neighbor and one for ourselves. 

If everyone were perfect, we would never learn about godly peace, patience, mercy, and compassion, for there would be no reason to bear up patiently or be longsuffering for God’s sake. But given our imperfections, God has ordained that we learn to bear one another’s burdens, for no one is without defect, no one is without weaknesses, no one is sufficient in himself, and no one wise enough by himself. Therefore, the right thing to do is to bear with one another, to comfort one another, to help, instruct, and admonish one another (Galatians 6:1-5; James 5:12-20).

How much strength of faith and godly character each one has is best proved during times of adversity – for such occasions do not make the godly frail, but show his true nature and the state of his character. 

### Chapter 17

_On a Christ-like life living in community_

If you wish to live in peace and harmony with other people, you must learn to die to self in many things. It is quite a challenge to live in a religious community or be part of a local church. It is even more of a challenge to live in any community or with any group of believers without complaint, and to remain a faithful participant until death. Blessed is the one who lives a humble, meek, peaceable, love-controlled life in such a group, and continues doing so to the end. 

If you want to stand firm in your faith and grow in Christ-likeness, as you ought, you must consider yourself an exile and pilgrim upon the earth (I Peter 2:11). Indeed, you must be willing to be considered a fool for Christ if you are going to pursue and live a holy, contemplative, neighbor-loving, God-pleasing life. 

Clothing and outward appearance are only of little benefit in living the Christ-like life. It is a change of heart, mind, and character, along with putting to death all your evil passions which make a person truly holy (Mark 7:21-23; Colossians 3:5-11). 

Seeking anything other than God and the spiritual health of your soul (i.e., fleshly pleasures, power, fame, fortune), leads only to tribulation and sorrow. Truly, if you do not daily make it your aim to be the least of all and the servant of all, you will soon lose the deep, inner peace of God which surpasses all comprehension. 

Within the Christian community, we have been called to endure difficult circumstances, difficult people, and hard work. We have not been called to a life of ease and trivial conversations. It is in these daily challenges of life that we are tested and tried, like gold in the furnace. Only those who truly humble themselves for God’s sake will remain steadfast and faithful in the face of the daily challenges that attend life in the religious community and local church. 


### Chapter 18

_On the example of those who have gone before_

Carefully examine the lives of God’s people who have set an example of living by faith and making exceedingly commendable progress in godliness, for then you will see how meager and feeble are your efforts to live a Christ-like life (Hebrews 11). Regrettably, our faith is weak and our progress in holiness barely measurable when compared to theirs. They, the saints and friends of Christ, served the Lord in hunger and thirst, in cold and with insufficient clothing, in hard work and weariness, in intercessory vigils and fastings, in prayer and holy meditations, in persecutions and many reproaches. 

Consider the numerous and grievous trials and tribulations endured by the Apostles, martyrs, evangelists, missionaries, pastors, and many other members of the Body of Christ who publicly professed faith in Christ, and lived accordingly. They willingly laid down their lives – losing them in this world – so that they might keep them in eternity (John 12:24-26; I John 2:15-17). 

Consider how strict and separated a life the Desert Fathers lived (those who dwelt in the desert to live a life of purity and contemplation). They suffered long and severe temptations in their pursuit of holiness. They were often assaulted by the wiles and fiery darts of the enemy (Ephesians 6:12). They spent hours in impassioned prayer, and while working, frequently poured out fervent prayers to God for protection from the evil one. They prayed for further progress in dying to self, for greater purity of heart and mind, for grace and strength to persevere, and for God to do in them what was impossible without Him. They kept strict and sometimes lengthy fasts. They manifested fervent zeal and a passionate desire for spiritual growth. They longed for more holiness and more intimate fellowship with God. They got up each day, put on the armor of God, fortified themselves with prayer and meditation, and spent the rest of the day bravely fighting their flesh and resisting the devil so that they would gain mastery over their vices instead of their vices having mastery over them (Numbers 33:55-56; Romans 8:13-14; Colossians 3:5-10). 

During the day, they worked hard at providing what was needed for life and sustenance. During the night hours, they often gave themselves to prayer. Yet even during working hours they did not cease from praying and communing with God in the quietness of their own mind. Indeed, they tried to make the most of what time they had here on the earth (Ephesians 5:15). Yet even the time they had seemed insufficient for being alone with God. And often the great sweetness of intimate fellowship with God (contemplation) caused them to neglect eating, sleeping, and other natural needs of the body. 

They renounced all riches (money, possessions), important positions, public praise and conferred honors, friends, and family (Luke 14:26-33). They neither wanted nor longed for anything from the world. They lived as simple a life-style as possible, barely allowing themselves the necessities of life. And even when their bodies cried out in need of food, shelter, warm clothing, or rest, they resisted for the sake of strengthening their focus on pursuing God and godliness. 

Therefore, they were very poor in earthly things, but exceeding rich in grace, godliness, and communion with God. Though the world looked on them as poor and even destitute, inwardly they were comforted and encouraged by the joy and peace of a righteous life and intimate communion with God. They were like strangers and aliens to the world, but family and dear friends to God. They were humble to the point of thinking themselves to be the least of all God’s people. The world looked on them as contemptible, but in the sight of God, they were precious and deeply loved. They steadfastly clung to true humility. They practiced simple obedience – to God and those in authority over them. They walked in love, meekness, and patience. Therefore, they were strong in spirit, and obtained great favor with God. 

They are an example to all who hunger and thirst after God and godliness – and we ought to make sure their example influences us toward holiness rather than allowing ourselves to be influenced toward lukewarm, mediocre, immature Christianity by the numerous self-focused and worldly minded Christians of our day. 

Consider how great a love for God these early Christians manifested; what devotion to prayer; what perseverance and zeal in their pursuit of holiness; what self-discipline; what reverence and submissive obedience in all things to those over them. The few that are like them today testify that they were truly holy and devout men who fought courageously, fervently, and persistently to turn their backs on the world and live for the glory and honor of God. 

Today we count a person great if he joins a monastery or is active in a local church, if he shows more zeal than most for evangelism or travels overseas as a missionary, or if he is a bit more righteous than the average lukewarm Christian. In our day there is a coldness of heart toward the things of God and an ongoing neglect of the spiritual disciplines. Indeed, many act as if God should serve and please them rather than they serve and please God. And is it not true that many hold God to be supreme in and over their lives in word mostly, while rarely treating Him as supreme in their choices and behavior? Are these not the reasons we have so little of the love and zeal demonstrated by those who have gone before? In fact, because laziness and lukewarmness are rampant, pursuing holiness (without which no one will see the Lord) is considered by many Christians to be an unwelcome, wearisome burden they do not want to bear. 

O may we – who have so many examples of godly men and women who have gone before – never allow the zealous and life-long pursuit of holiness to fall asleep in us. 

### Chapter 19

_On the spiritual exercises (disciplines) of a Christian_

As Christians, our lives ought to be adorned with all the virtues of Christ (Matthew 5:48) so that we will be inwardly what we appear or claim to be outwardly. In fact, to please God, we must make purity and holiness within the foundation of what we are without, for God clearly sees what is in our heart, and we cannot deceive Him. He knows if we genuinely fear Him and whole-heartedly love Him. He knows if we are walking in purity before Him, wherever we go or whatever we do (Hebrews 4:12-13). 

Each day we ought to affirm our longing for and commitment to purity within and holiness without, so that we feed and stimulate zeal for this pursuit as if each day were the first day of our conversion. Each day we ought to pray, “Help me, O God, in my pursuit of You and in my service to You, and grant that today would be a day of great spiritual progress, for up until now it is as if I have not progressed at all.” 

According to our longing for purity within and holiness without, so shall the speed of our progress be in growing in godliness (Matthew 5:6). Yet longing alone is not enough. Daily diligence in pursuing the things that make for advancement in spiritual growth is required if we are to make commendable progress. For certainly if those who boldly and zealously commit to great things still fall short, how much more will those fall short who rarely or only half-heartedly make such commitments? And though various circumstances can divert our attention from following through on such commitments, the slightest neglect of those disciplines that produce spiritual growth results in some decline of our spiritual health. 

Both the longing for purity within and holiness without, and taking the action necessary to fulfill that longing depends more on the grace of God than on our own wisdom and self-discipline. Therefore it says: “The righteous live by faith” (Habakkuk 2:4; Romans 1:17; Galatians 3:11; Hebrews 10:38). This means they continually depend on God for the needed grace and strength to accomplish whatever they have committed themselves to do. For though man makes his plans, it is God who sees sufficiently to guide his steps (Proverbs 16:9), for man does not naturally know the way he should go (Jeremiah 10:23).

If some daily discipline necessary for spiritual health and further growth in godliness is set aside for a specific religious activity or for showing kindness to another, it can easily be made up at a later time. But if you neglect a daily discipline because it has become distasteful to you or you are feeling lazy, then your neglect is sin (James 4:17) and you will reap according to what you have sown (Galatians 6:7-9). 

No matter how hard we try or how disciplined we are, we will still fall short of Christian perfection in many things. Therefore, we should establish specific goals for growing in Christ-likeness and continue pursuing them until they are reached (I Corinthians 9:24-27). And more then that, we must commit ourselves to making daily progress in defeating those sins which most easily beset us, putting godly character traits and habits in their place (Hebrews 12:1-2). 

It is vital that we carefully and diligently examine our outer and inner life, bringing both into conformity with the will and word of God, because both must be changed for us to make progress in holiness. If the more common demands of life prevent you from continually examining yourself, then you can do it each morning and evening, or at the very least just prior to taking Holy Communion and during certain seasons, such as Advent and Lent. 

Each morning speak to God about your commitment to godliness and prepare your heart and mind to please Him in whatever you encounter that day. Each evening examine how you lived that day in thought, word, and deed – for these are the areas where you are likely to offend God and your neighbor. 

Like a courageous soldier in battle, fight against the attacks of the devil. Keep your appetite and eating habits under control, for that will teach you to have the fortitude to keep all your fleshly desires under control. Always have something to do – be it reading something that edifies your soul, or writing, or praying, or meditating, or doing something useful for those around you. Though physical exercise is good, use it with caution and in moderation so that it doesn’t become a hindrance to doing what is best. And free yourself from thinking you must do the same spiritual disciplines others do. Choose the activities that work best for you. 

Should you find specific spiritual disciplines that are helpful to you, yet are not commonly practiced by all, do them in private and avoid telling others about them so that you give no occasion for pride to arise. And do not justify being careless or negligent in practicing the common spiritual disciplines by thinking your private ones are superior. Rather, faithfully and honestly do all the spiritual disciplines that are requested or required of you by the church and any smaller or lesser group of Christians you belong to (i.e., Bible study, accountability group). If you still have free time after fulfilling these requests and requirements, devote yourself to those specific disciplines you personally find so helpful. 

Though there are common spiritual disciplines, all do not suit each believer the same. Some suit this Christian better, and others that one. Even in keeping the seasonal observances like Advent and Lent, some disciplines are better for one than another. We need one kind of discipline in times of temptation and others in times of peace and quietness. Some serve us better in times of sadness, and others when we are filled with the joy of the Lord. 

When we come to the times of sharing in Holy Communion or the special days surrounding Christmas, Easter, Pentecost Sunday, or other such times, we should search our hearts for unconfessed sin and renew our commitment to those spiritual disciplines that strengthen our faith and drive us toward purity of heart and life. We ought to go from one special occasion to another as if the time between were our last here on earth and our entrance into the eternal kingdom is imminent. 

We ought to prepare day by day, so as to live as prepared ones – urged on by our participation in the special observances of the Church. We ought to live each day as if we would soon hear those words, “Well done, good and faithful servant,” and receive our reward from the hand of God. And if God puts off calling us home for a time, we ought to consider ourselves still ill-prepared and unworthy for the glory that is to be revealed to us. 

Therefore, in a self-disciplined, deliberate, purposeful, zealous manner – as if preparing to take the most challenging and important exam of your life – prepare yourself to live godly each day and to be pleasing to God on the judgment day (II Timothy 2:15). It is the Lord who said, "Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his master will make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of food in due season? Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. Truly, I say to you that he will make him ruler over all that he has” (Luke 12:42-44). 

### CHAPTER 20

_On the love of solitude and silence_

Schedule suitable times for thoughtful reading of the scriptures, contemplating God, considering His ways, and meditating on His word. During your times of contemplation and meditation, frequently review the many mercies God has showered on you. Do not spend time on questions about God and the scripture which can only be answered by speculation or inference, in that they have no clear answer in the scripture. Trying to answer such questions may be mentally stimulating and personally entertaining, but it produces no spiritual benefits. Instead, study and contemplate those things that bring about in you a broken and contrite heart over sin. 

If you do your best to avoid worthless conversations, useless or profitless activities, currently popular attractions, and gossip, you will have sufficient time each day to profitably read and meditate. The greatest saints of the past avoided useless and unprofitable social interaction, as much as they could, choosing rather to protect time for solitude and silence with God. Someone once said, “As often as I have gone among men, so often have I returned less a man.” Is this not the Christian’s experience when he strays too long into things that turn his attention away from God or that war against what God would have him be? 

Truly, it is easier to remain silent in meditation and prayer than to refrain from speaking too much in social settings. It is easier to remain secluded in your usual place of study and meditation than to vigilantly guard your thoughts, words, and actions while out and about. Therefore, if you long to gain a pure heart, to pursue holiness of life, to touch the heart of God, to enjoy intimate fellowship with God, to comprehend and apply the truths of scripture that make you more and more like Christ, you must go with Jesus apart from the multitude (Mark 1:35; Luke 5:16). 

Consider this carefully, no one who does not love his times of solitude and silence with God at home is spiritually profited by traveling to such places as the historical sites of the Old Testament saints, the seven churches of Revelation, or the Holy Land. No one will remain spiritually vigilant when talking in social settings, who does not love his times of thoughtfully reading the scriptures and meditating on God and His word. No one selflessly and fairly rules over others who does not love submitting to the rule of God and to the rule of those in authority over him. No one meekly and humbly commands who does not love to obey. And no one sincerely rejoices over the love, mercy, and goodness of God who has not mourned over the heinousness of his rebellion and sin, and then repented and changed his ways so as to have a good conscience toward God. 

The most holy of God’s people have a boldness to come into His presence and call upon His name that always includes a reverential fear of God. And though their purity of heart, singleness of mind, and holiness of life is evident to all, their fear of God is also made evident by their abiding sense of unworthiness, sincere humility, and faithful obedience. 

However, the boldness of those Christians who knowingly practice sin springs from pride and presumption. Such ill-gotten boldness leads to three false beliefs: (1) that we can see God without purity of heart (Matthew 5:8); (2) that salvation is necessary while sanctification is optional (John 14:23; Hebrews 12:14); and (3) that after rising to certain levels of spiritual maturity we cannot fall away (Hebrews 3:12-13; II Peter 3:17-18). Therefore, no matter how devout and spiritually mature you think you have become in this life, never tell yourself you have reached the place of being secure in your faith. 

Too often those who are esteemed as the most spiritual among us fall into grievous sin, because their confidence gets placed in what others think of them. Therefore, it is to our benefit to be inwardly and frequently tested by such things as the temptation to spiritual pride, or a foolish sense of self-righteousness, or the arrogance of thinking we have attained sinless perfection. Such testing remind us of our constant need for vigilance against temptation, and our need for a healthy fear of God, humility before God and men, and ears that are deaf to the praises of men. 

Truly, it is the one who turns away from temporal pleasures and guards against entanglements in the world who has the purer and therefore healthier conscience. It is the one who casts aside all worthless thoughts, anxiety, and foolish concerns, who thinks only [or at least mostly] on heavenly and edifying things, who builds his security and hope upon God, and who possess deep inward peace and calmness of mind. 

Only those who diligently seek a broken and contrite heart to the point of mourning over their sin are worthy of heavenly comfort and encouragement (Psalm 51:7; Matthew 5:4; Isaiah 66:2). If you long to feel sincere regret over your sin – so as to have a broken and contrite heart, go to your place of solitude and silence where you can shut out the distractions of the world and, as it is written, “Commune with your own heart in your place of solitude and silence (upon your bed), and be still” (Psalms 4:4). It is there in the stillness, before our Holy God, that you will be able to see the reality of your rebellion against God (I John 3:4), the extent of your sinfulness (James 4:17)), the cost of your sin to God (II Corinthians 5:21; I Peter 3:18), and its effect on your relationship with God (James 4:4). If God is your greatest treasure, if you love God with all your being, you cannot face these truths without weeping before God with a broken and contrite heart. 

It is in your quiet place – with an open and honest heart before God – that you find what you so easily lose when bombarded by the demands and distractions of life. If you will go to your quiet place often and stay there longer, your time there will grow exceedingly sweet. But if you rarely go there, going will become a wearisome burden. If from the first days of becoming a Christian [or from the first days of seeing its value] you go to your quiet place often and for prolonged periods of time, you will soon find it a dear friend, a place of comfort and rest, a place to gain spiritual strength, and a place of intimate communion with God. 

It is in the times of solitude and silence that devout Christians tenderize their hearts toward God as they prepare for the spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical challenges of that day. It is in these same quiet times that God-fearing Christians discover, study, and take to heart the deeper truths of scripture which are missed or misunderstood by so many. This is valuable, because it is these deeper truths which nurture a broken and contrite heart over sin – bringing us to tears of remorse, confession, and cleansing. And these same deeper truths compel us to further distance ourselves from worldly attractions and distractions so that we may grow ever dearer to our Maker and Savior. And should we go so far as to withdraw ourselves from acquaintances and friends, God – with His holy angels – will draw ever so near to us. 

It is better to be unknown because you give so much time to examining and making right your own heart before God than to be well-known for working miracles to the neglect of your inward spiritual condition. It is praiseworthy to long for time alone with God so that you spend more time in your quiet place than in seeing the world, visiting holy sites, traveling to spiritual life conferences, attending Christian concerts, serving in the church, or socializing with other Christians. 

Why spend time seeking what is not eternal and therefore will not last? The world and all that is in it which feeds our passions and powerful desires will pass away. It is the passions of your flesh which drive you to see and experience what you cannot keep. Such passions can never be satisfied to the point of no longer crying for further gratification. This means they will rise within again and again – further dulling your conscience and distracting you from what truly matters. Therefore, carefully consider these words: “A joyful going forth often brings a sorrowful return, and a joyous evening of socializing often makes a sad morning” (Proverbs 14:12-13). 

What can you find or learn or see or discover “out there” which you cannot gain from God, the scriptures, a purer heart, the revealing and convicting work of the Holy Spirit, the spiritual people God has placed in your life, and those parts of God’s marvelous creation which you can see at home? The same God works in the same ways in your quiet place and in your home and in your place of employment and in your church, as in any historical holy site, popular Christian conference or concert, famous church, and national Christian retreat center somewhere out there.

Is there anything you can see on this earth that is eternal in nature – that will last longer than the earth itself? Possibly you believe that if you can attend just one more conference, or finally see the Holy Land, or hear a certain Christian musician in person, or attend a specific retreat where a well-known Christian is speaking, you will come away so satisfied that you will want or need nothing more. Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, if you could see all there is to see all at once, it would still not be enough. 

Lift up your eyes to God on high and pray that your sins and failures to live up to what you know may be forgiven. Leave vain things and foolish endeavors to vain and foolish men. Set your mind on things above and diligently pursue the things that God has commanded you to do. Therefore, go into your quiet place and fix your eyes, your mind, and your heart on Jesus – your beloved. Take the time to commune with him in your quiet place, for you will find no greater peace, encouragement, or comfort anywhere else. 

Those who seek the new, the novel, and the spiritually popular outside their quiet place, rather than seeking Jesus within, easily lose – during the trials and hardships of life – the peace, encouragement, and comfort that comes from quiet communion with Jesus. If we follow their foolish example in pursuing the new, the novel, and the spiritually popular, we will – like them – suffer trouble of heart and spiritual decline. 

### Chapter 21

_On compunction of heart_

Compunction: poignant grief proceeding from a sense of guilt or consciousness of causing pain; the pain occasioned by a wounded and awakened conscience. 

Synonyms: Remorse: Anguish of soul under a sense of guilt or consciousness of having offended God or brought evil upon one's self or others. 

Contrition: Self-condemnation and humiliation leading to and producing repentance.

If you are to make measurable and commendable progress in godliness, cling to the fear of God and do not long for any freedom that opens the door to distractions or impediments to spiritual growth (Proverbs 19:23). Use self-discipline to keep your senses and physical desires from leading you astray, and especially avoid senseless amusements and hilarity. 

Nurture compunction – with its attending qualities of remorse and contrition – and you will find growing within you a devotion to God like that spoken of in the first and great commandment. Indeed, compunction opens the door to many of the good things God has for us, including spiritual growth and intimate fellowship with Him. Without compunction, we easily set aside the exercise of self-discipline and pursue self-gratification – which results in the loss of those good things God has for us. 

After thoughtfully considering and seriously weighing what we deserve from God in contrast to what God so graciously gives, and upon coming to an understanding of the numerous dangers to our spiritual progress and soul’s well-being, it is astonishing that any Christian can heartily rejoice in this life. 

Sadly, many laugh when they ought to cry because they have a carefree attitude or a lack of concern toward their shortcomings. Such attitudes and thinking desensitizes them to the pain their sin causes God, the unjust harm it does to others, and the setback it brings to their own spiritual progress (Ezekiel 6:9; Psalm 78:40; Hebrews 10:26-31; James 4:4-9; II Peter 2:4-11). 

There is no true freedom in Christ or real Christian joy apart from the fear of God, a pure heart, and a good conscience. The one who turns away from every cause of distraction – be it worldly, social, fleshly, emotional, or intellectual – in order to focus on holy compunction is truly blessed, and finds real Christian joy. The one who resists, puts off, and dies to whatever stains or hardens his conscience is truly blessed and finds real Christian joy. Therefore, fight with all your might against anything that turns you away from God and toward the world, your flesh, and the devil, because – by the grace and empowerment of God – old sinful habits can be defeated and replaced with new holy habits.

If you will let others alone so they can do what they need to do, they will gladly let you alone so you can focus on what you need to do. Do not involve yourself in the affairs of others as if they needed your advice or as if their lives were yours to manage. And do not entangle yourself in the business of those superior to you – as if you needed their recognition or wanted their fame or knew more than them. First and foremost, focus on your own life and the challenges attendant to it. Give yourself advice and heed it before offering advice to your dearest friends. 

Do not be bothered or discouraged if you lack the favor or praise of others. However, you ought to be bothered and concerned if you do not require yourself to make an effort equal to the need to think, speak, and behave in ways that are worthy of a child and faithful servant of God (i.e., a Christian). 

It is often spiritually better and safer for us to have fewer comforts in this life, especially in relation to those comforts that please or gratify our flesh. However, if we lack or rarely experience God’s gracious comforts, it is our own fault – for two primary reasons. First, we are not yet seriously seeking a broken and contrite heart so that we weep over our sin (compunction of heart). Second, we are not yet turning our back on or completely casting away those forms of comfort which are worthless and worldly. 

Our walk with God will be richer and stronger, more humble and grateful if we will see ourselves as unworthy of divine comfort and relief, and instead see ourselves as worthy of God’s discipline and life’s tribulations (Hebrews 12:3-11).

When a Christian has reached maturity in relation to compunction, than worldly beliefs, values, fashions, novelties, entertainments, riches, possessions, and culturally approved practices seem oppressive, offensive, and bitter. 

The sincere-minded Christian – one who loves God and wants to please Him in all he does – finds sufficient reasons for mourning and weeping; for whether he is examining his own heart, thoughts, desires, words, choices, and actions, or is pondering his neighbor’s life, he knows no one is so holy as to live in this world without temptation and occasional sin. In fact, the more thoroughly he examines himself in the light of God’s holiness, the more thoroughly he mourns and weeps. Indeed, the sins and ungodly habits, worldly ways and fleshly desires that still charm us, and therefore distract us from setting our mind on things above (Colossians 3:1-3), are reason enough for the mourning and weeping of true compunction. 

If you contemplated your death and the subsequent judgment of God more often, rather than glibly assuming you will live a long life, it would compel you to be more zealous about putting off sin and putting on Christ-likeness (Ecclesiastes 7:2-5). And if you would contemplate the horrors and suffering of hell (Matthew 13:40-42; Luke 16:19-31), I believe you would willingly embrace God’s discipline and endure whatever He deemed necessary to transform you into the person Christ saved you to be – in relation to holiness and service (Philippians 3:10-14). And if you would persistently pursue loving God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, you would love righteousness and hate evil. However, those who won’t allow conviction of sin to pierce their heart, and who still treasure worldly or fleshly pleasures will remain spiritually cold and indifferent to God’s longing for us to grow strong in faith, holy in character, and Christ-like in behavior. 

The most common reason we are discontent, easily complain, and quickly blame others for our attitude or actions is spiritual weakness due to either insignificant or unreasonably slow growth in faith, character, and Christ-likeness. Pray humbly and earnestly, therefore, that God will graciously give you the spirit of compunction with its attending qualities of remorse and contrition. Use the language of the Psalmist who said, “Feed me, O Lord, with the bread of tears, and give me plenty of tears to drink (Psalm 80:5). And continue praying this way until God has fully answered your prayer. 

### Chapter 22

_On contemplating the weakness of our humanity_

No matter where you are or where you go to find happiness, you will soon become discontent, and ultimately unhappy, unless you turn to God and make Him your source of contentment, security, inner peace, and eternal joy. 

Why do you so easily become unhappy, frustrated, and even angry when things don’t go according to your wishes and desires? Is there anyone whose life always goes according to what he wants? No! Neither you, nor I, nor anyone one on the earth has such a life. There is no one in the entire world, past or present, king or pope, priest or highly esteemed pastor, who has had a life free from trouble, disappointment, hardship, and suffering. Who, then, has the better life or the most satisfying circumstances in life? The one who has the humility, holiness, and willingness to suffer for the sake and glory of God (Luke 9:23-25; II Timothy 3:10-12; Philippians 4:11-13). 

There are many foolish and immature people who say, “See what a prosperous life that man has, how rich and how great he is, how powerful, how exalted.” But look intently on the good things of God – the things that last for eternity – and you will see that all worldly possessions, fame, and fortune are not only fleeting, they profit you nothing in eternity (Luke 12:15-21). Besides, earthly treasures are a wearying burden, because they cannot be possessed without anxiety and fear (Proverbs 15:16-17). Truly, happiness does not consist in the abundance of temporal things – as proven by the fact that we are capable of being satisfied and filled with joy by a much smaller, more moderate amount. 

The sincere Christian understands that life upon the earth is filled with trials and temptations, affliction and distress. In fact the more he yearns for and pursues purity of heart and holiness of life, the more he sees the weakness of his humanity and understands how prone he is to failure. The more he sees his weaknesses and propensity to  failure, the more he realizes how easily the world around him stirs and magnifies them – which is why life on earth seems so distasteful and even wretched to him. 

For example, there is the constant temptation of overeating, excessive drinking, inordinate sleeping, and laziness – plus the more hidden temptations such as pride, self-righteousness, ungodly judgment of others, greed, immoral desires, anger, and bitterness. Beyond these things there are the natural necessities of food, shelter, and clothing, which require constant work to provide even the barest amount. 

Indeed, the Christian who diligently applies himself to pursuing a pure heart and a godly life gets so involved in putting on the armor of God, prayer, vigilance against the intrusion of anything ungodly, resisting temptation, confessing sins, and caring for the natural necessities of life that it seems to him there is too little time left for meditation and intimate communion with God. This too is why the sincere Christian sees life on this earth as distasteful and even wretched. 

In fact, the inner man of the sincere Christian feels heavily burdened by having to constantly war against the evil desires of his flesh as well as care for the natural functions and needs of his body. This is why the Psalmist earnestly prays to be freed from these constraints on his meditation and intimate communion with God, saying, “Relieve the distress of my heart, bring me out of my constraint” (Psalm 25:17 - NJB). 

O the foolishness of those who add needless trouble to their lives by living in denial or being dishonest with themselves about the weaknesses of their humanity and their inclination to do what they know is wrong. And yet, how much more foolish and how much more trouble comes to those who love the life offered by this sin-sick and spiritually-destructive world. There are some who treasure the temporal pleasures, possessions, riches, and fame of this life so much that if they could live a self-pleasing life here forever, they would have not interest in the Kingdom of God. 

Oh the foolish and faithless of heart of those who have gotten involved and immersed so deeply in worldly things that they relish little more than the things which please their flesh. They do not realize how miserable they are! And sadly, they probably won’t acknowledge the truth until the judgment day, when they will undeniably see that the things they loved were vile and worthless. But by then, it will be too late to amend their ways.

The Old Testament saints and all the loyal friends of Christ held as nothing those things that pleased the flesh, or were fashionable or profitable from the world’s perspective. Rather, their hope for something better and their affections were set on the things which are above (Colossians 3:1-4). In fact, they fixed their heart and mind on those things that are eternal and invisible so they would not be attracted to and distracted by those things that are temporal and visible (Hebrews 12:2; Proverbs 26:11; II Peter 2:22). 

Dear brother and sister in Christ, vigilantly guard against losing even the least bit of fervor and determination for making faithful, measurable, and commendable progress in the knowledge of God, in meditating on the holy scriptures, in purity of heart, in living a godly life, and in intimate fellowship with the Father. Indeed, as long as you remain alive in this world, do everything you can to nurture and encourage a robust hunger for God and His righteousness. Why waste the time you have, or put off until tomorrow an intentional, disciplined, persistent pursuit of God and a holy life? Get going. Take charge of your time. Say to yourself, “Now is the time to act on my hunger and thirst for righteousness, now is the time to fight against the evil of my flesh and the world, now is the time to seriously pursue a pure heart and a holy life” (Ephesians 5:15-16; II Corinthians 6:2b). 

When you feel like nothing is going right, and your mind is being bombarded by wrong thinking, and you are struggling to cling to the peace of God within, that is the time to persevere because you are on the edge of being blessed by new insights about God, stronger faith, greater purity of heart, and progress in holy living (James 1:2-4; Romans 5:3-5; I Peter 1:6-9). Sometimes God takes you through, and sometimes God allows you to pass through fire and water in order to bring you into that spiritual wealth which only comes through His purifying processes (Romans 8:28-29). Indeed, there is no other way to gain this wealth, for unless you do violence to your flesh, to your sinful habits, and to your unholy thinking, you will not gain victory over your faults. 

As long as we live in this mortal body, we will never achieve sinless perfection or be free from the burdens and troubles of life. Who of us does not long for rest from all the hardships and suffering of this life – whether they come from our sinful choices, spiritual weaknesses, unrelenting temptations, sickness, hunger, unjust or cruel people, tragedy, natural disasters, persecution, or the death of a loved one? Yet because we have lost our innocence by choosing to rebel against God (James 4:17), we have also lost perfect blessedness (life without trouble). Therefore, we must be patient and wait for the mercy of God to bring an end to the ravaging effects of sin, and to swallow up mortality with eternal life (Romans 8:18-23; II Corinthians 5:1-5; II Peter 3:8-13). 

O how great is the frailty of human nature as proven by the ease with which it so frequently chooses to partake of the ways of the flesh, the world, and the devil (Genesis 6:5-6). Consider: you confess your sins today and tomorrow you commit the same sins you confessed today. In a moment of spiritual zeal you resolve to resist a particular temptation or flee a particular unholy desire, and within a short time you act as if you never made such a resolution. Such weakness and instability is reason enough to humble ourselves so that we never think we are better than we really are (Romans 12:16). Indeed, it does not take much in the way of carelessness to quickly lose (take two steps backwards) what we have hardly attained through the enabling power of God’s grace, much self-discipline, and prolonged perseverance. 

What will our spiritual condition be in the future if right now we are lukewarm, inattentive, and undisciplined? Woe to us if we assume we have become the godly person Christ saved us to be so as to rest from a continued pursuit of holiness and turn to enjoying the pleasures and possessions of this world. If we compare ourselves to Christ, as we ought, instead of comparing ourselves to those we deem less godly, we will surely see that our character and behavior still lacks sufficient proof of true godliness. Therefore, the best thing for us to do until our dying day, is to act as if we are just beginning the Christian life, and seek out godly teachers to instruct us in the holiness and ways of God, because in this there is genuine hope for a spiritual growth and a holy living that pleases the Lord. 

### Chapter 23

_On meditating upon death_

Your time of life on earth quickly passes and soon comes to an end (Job 9:25-26). Therefore, give serious consideration to how it will be for you when you leave this world and enter the next. Today you are alive, and tomorrow you are gone – and no one sees you anymore. Once you are out of sight, you are soon forgotten. How careless, foolish, and hard of heart is the one who thinks only of this present life and does not properly consider and therefore prepare for life after death. 

The wisest thing to do is to live each day, in thought, word, and deed, as if it were your last. In fact, if you keep a good conscience before God and before men, you will hardly have any fear of death (Acts 24:14-16). Therefore, it is better to devote yourself to guarding against sin than to living a longer life (Luke 12:35-37). 

If you are not ready to die and meet God today – because you have put off getting ready until tomorrow, how do you know you will be ready tomorrow? Tomorrow is as uncertain as your next breath, for no one knows if they will have a tomorrow (Matthew 24:42-44, 25:1-13). 

How are you profited by living a long life if you do not pursue a holy life, as God intends? A long life is no guarantee that we will finally die to self and live for Him who died and rose again on our behalf (II Corinthians 5:14-15). In fact, many who live a long life increase their guilt, because they have more time to sin. Imagine how much better it would be if you lived but one day, yet lived it as God wills you to live and Christ saved you to live. 

There are many who publicly proclaim the number of years since they repented and were converted by faith in God through Jesus Christ. Yet too many of them have very little of the fruit of the Spirit and the fruit of the Light to show for it (Galatians 5:22-24; Ephesians 5:6-9). If it is a fearful thing to die, it may – all the more – be a dangerous thing to live a long life, given the weaknesses of our humanity. Spiritually blessed and inwardly peaceful is the one who lives each day knowing he is going to die so that he spends each day preparing to meet God. 

If you have ever seen someone die or attended a funeral, fix it in your mind that you, too, will one day follow them down that same path (Hebrews 9:27-28). In the morning, ponder the possibility that you might not live to see the evening. And when evening comes, do not be so bold as to assume that you will see the next day (James 4:13-16). 

Live each day prepared to meet death so death can never find you unprepared, because you, like so many others, may die suddenly and unexpectedly. As the scripture says, “Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect” (Matthew 24:44). When your hour of death comes, it will be too late to begin thinking seriously about how you have lived. So if you have not lived unto God, all that will be left is to weep bitterly over your negligence and lack of effort in relation to pursuing God and a holy life. 

How happy and wise is the one who strives each day to live the kind of life he will wish he had lived upon facing death. A complete contempt of the world, a fervent desire to excel in godliness, the love of discipline – both God’s discipline and self-discipline, broken heartedness and tears of sorrow in confession and repentance, eagerness to obey, the denial of self, willing submission to any hardship or suffering for the love of Christ – these are the things that fill us with confidence and joy at the prospect of death (I Corinthians 9:24; II Timothy 4:6-8). 

While you have health you have many opportunities, sufficient strength, and clarity of mind to aggressively and zealously pursue a holy life and godly service. But when you are afflicted with sickness you may not be able to do much at all. Very few turn prolonged infirmity into a holier, more deeply spiritual life, just as those who frequently visit holy sites, travel to spiritual life conferences, or attend Christian concerts seldom become Christ-like. 

Do not trust in the righteousness of your friends and family to save you from the judgment of God (Psalm 33:13-21; Isaiah 31:1; Jeremiah 17:5-7). Do not put off repentance, faith unto salvation, and the process of sanctification without which no one will see the Lord (Hebrews 12:14). Though many help you now, no one can answer for you or stand in your place at the final judgment day. Wisdom calls you to make proper provision in life, to send holy living and loving deeds ahead of you in preparation to meet God in death (Matthew 6:19-20). Truly, if you do not do this for yourself now, no one can do this for you after you die. If you are not properly and appropriately concerned with spiritual matters before death, all the concern afterward, even by those who love you, will do you no good. Now is the time that matters most – for it is the time you have. As God says: “Now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation” (II Corinthians 6:2). 

But sadly, many do not spend their time here as they ought – laying up rich treasure in heaven that will profit them richly for eternity. Truly, the hour is coming when they will long for just one more day, even one more hour, to properly and appropriately prepare to meet God – yet it may be that God will not grant them such an hour before they die. 

Oh, dearly beloved, you can free yourself from serious danger and the fear of judgment to come if you will continually cling to a spiritually invigorating fear of God and the expectation of death. Make it your determined and fervent intention to live in such a way that in the hour of death you are able to rejoice rather than fear. Learn now to die to the temporal allurements, pleasures, riches, possessions, and admiration of the world so that you live for Christ in this life and with Christ in the next (Romans 6:1-11). Learn now to despise everything in this world, including any wishes and desires that supplant Christ as your Lord and as the supreme love of your life. If you do this, nothing will stand between God and you when you go to Him in the next life (Luke 14:26-33). Exercise vigilant control over your fleshly desires and urges so they do not gain control over you, then you will have confidence to enter the presence of God in this life and in the next (I Corinthians 9:24-27; Hebrews 10:19-22; I John 3:2-10). 

It is foolish to think that you will live long enough to put off until tomorrow what you ought to pay attention to today, especially since you cannot be sure you will be alive tomorrow. Many have lived in this deception only to have their life snatched away without warning. How many times have you heard of someone being slain by the sword, another drowned, another falling from someplace high and breaking his neck, another who died while eating, and yet another who died while playing. Do you not see that when one person dies by fire, another by a fatal accident, another by disease, and another by robber that death comes to all of us and that life is like a shadow that quickly passes away (Job 14:1-2)? 

Who will remember you after you die? Who will be able to make up the things you should have done but did not do, once you leave this earth? Therefore, dear one, devote yourself now to loving God above all else and to a serious, whole-hearted pursuit of a holy life. And do this with all your might. 

While you have time, lay up for yourself eternal treasure in heaven (Matthew 6:19-20; Galatians 6:7-8). Think on nothing but your salvation, your love of God, and your growth in godliness. Care for nothing but the things of God. Make friends for yourself by living like the saints of old (Hebrews 11), so that when you come to the end of your life here, they will receive you there into God’s eternal kingdom (Luke 16:9). 

Think and live as a stranger and pilgrim upon the earth – as one who won’t allow the things of this world to get in the way of doing or possessing that which has eternal value. Keep your heart free from earthly encumbrances and fleshly desires so that you can continually set it on God (Colossians 3:1-4; I Peter 2:11), for this passing world is not our home (Hebrews 13:14). Pray daily – and often during each day (I Thessalonians 5:17). Confess your sins to the Lord with a humble and broken heart (I John 1:9). Earnestly, and even with tears, pour out your prayers for grace and strength to be more and more conformed to the image of Christ (Ephesians 3:14-19). Finally, put off the old self and put on the new self (Ephesians 4:22-24) so that after death your spirit may be found worthy of joyful passage unto its Lord. Amen. 

### Chapter 24

_On the judgment and punishment of the wicked_

In all that you do, remember that a final judgment day is coming when you will stand before an exacting judge (Matthew 10:28; Hebrews 10:30-31), from whom nothing can be hidden (I Corinthians 4:5), who cannot be bribed (Deuteronomy 10:16-18), and who will not accept excuses (II Corinthians 5:9-10), for He judges each one righteously (Psalm 96:10; Romans 2:5-11). 

O careless and foolish sinner – who sometimes wants to flee when seeing merely the facial expression of someone who is angry at you – what will you do when you stand before God, who knows all the wrongs you have ever done? Why not adequately prepare now for the day of judgment – a day when you must stand before God alone, with no one standing along side you to plead your case or offer well-contrived explanations? Only while you live here on the earth will your efforts at pursuing a pure heart and a holy life produce the fruit that is counted as treasure in heaven. Only while you live in this world is your broken-hearted weeping over sin acceptable to God. Only while you live here is your groaning in prayer for God’s grace and strength to live a godly life heard by God. Only in this life is your humble sorrow over all the ways you have displeased God, pleasing to God. And only in this life do such things as these bring cleansing to your heart, mind, mouth, and behavior in preparation for the judgment to come. Indeed, none of these will help you once you have crossed from this life to the next. 

The trusting, patient Christian finds great opportunities for further purification of his heart and mind in the trials, hardships, and sufferings of life (James 1:2-4). The proof that he is intentionally taking advantage of these opportunities is verified in the following ways. When wronged, he grieves more over the spiritual condition of the one harming him than over the injury done to him. When praying, he willingly and fervently prays for those who mistreat him – holding no grudge or ill will against them and forsaking any ungodly attitude toward them (Luke 6:27-31; Ephesians 4:31-32). Upon becoming aware of any wrong he has done, he quickly confesses his sin, asks forgiveness, and makes things right with God and those he has wronged. When offended, he is swifter to nurture compassion and mercy than to arouse anger. And he daily denies himself so that he can more fully subject the will of his flesh to the rule of the Spirit (Luke 9:23; Galatians 5:16-17,24). 

Once again, it is better to die to self and come alive to Christ now – so that you become more and more like Christ in this life – than to allow the practice of sin to go unchecked, for surely you will not go unpunished in this life and in the next (Romans 13:11-14; Ephesians 4:17-24; I John 3:9). 

The greatest threat to a holy life is self-deception, or living in denial, or allowing some earthly fear to override your fear of God, or a stubborn refusal to face up to the truth regarding an unholy love for certain pleasures of the flesh. 

What else but your sins will stoke the fires of hell? The more you spare yourself from the disciplines and sacrifices of a holy life, and the more you give in to the desires of your flesh, the more fuel you are piling up for the burning so that your punishment is more severe in the hereafter (Matthew 16:24-27). For to the measure we rebel against God and go our own sinful way, to that measure we will be punished (Luke 12:47-48; Ephesians 5:3-7). 

In the fires of hell, the lazy will be driven to action by burning goads (a pointed instrument, like spurs, used to urge on an animal), and the gluttons will be tormented with intolerable hunger and thirst. The lovers of luxury and the pursuers of pleasure will be plunged into burning pitch (a thick, black, sticky substance made by boiling down tar) and stinking brimstone (a hard substance that gives off the foul odor of sulphur when heated), and the envious and greedy will howl in their sorrow like mad dogs. 

Every sin will have its own proper punishment. The self-assured (proud) will be bewildered by utter confusion, and the greedy will be forced to suffer miserable poverty. An hour’s suffering there will be worse than a hundred years of weeping over your sins and loathing yourself for being such a heinous sinner. And surely it will be far worse than a hundred years of the harshest penance (voluntary self-punishment to express your repentance for sins committed). Remember that here we can sometimes find a break from the pain, and we can sometimes find temporary joy in the solace of friends. But in the midst of hell, there is no place to go, even for a time, to get away from the pain or find comfort in the midst of your suffering. 

Therefore, be broken-hearted, sorrowful, and repentant now over your sins so that in the day of judgment you may stand before God with boldness – along with all the other godly Christians. Indeed, the righteous man will stand with great boldness before those who have afflicted and oppressed him because they deemed him to be evil (Wisdom 5:1-5). The godly man – the one who with the meekness and humility of Christ submits to the judgments of men – will judge men. And the poor and the lowly will have great confidence, while the proud will be overcome with great fear (Revelation 6:12-17). In that day it will become evident to all that the wise in this world were the ones who learned to be fools and despised for Christ. 

Then we will delight in all the tribulation, hardship, and suffering we bore patiently to the honor of God, while the ungodly will have nothing to get excited about. Then the godly will rejoice, but the sinner – those who lived lawless, selfish, and morally depraved lives – will mourn and weep. Then the one who denied his flesh and put to death his earthly urges, who sacrificed his own will to do the will of Jesus, will rejoice far more than if he had been blessed with all earthly benefits, pleasures, and riches (II Corinthians 4:16-18). Then the poor in heart and humble in life will be clothed with the beauty of Jesus (Isaiah 61:3; I John 3:2), and those the world highly honors will be exposed for the vile people they are. Then the weak and lowly for Christ’s sake will be held in higher esteem than the rich and famous in this life. Then patient endurance will be shown to be stronger than all the power of the world. Then simple obedience will be more highly exalted than all the knowledge and wisdom of this world. Then a pure and properly functioning conscience will be more cause for rejoicing than knowing all there is to know about theology. Then contempt for worldly riches will be shown to be worth more than all the cumulative wealth of this world. Then you will find more comfort in having spent much time in fervent prayer than in luxurious living. Then you will be glad you kept silent (letting others talk and teach) then in making sure your views were heard. Then godly behavior will be worth far more than many spiritually sounding, well-spoken words. Then a well disciplined life and a sincere mourning over sin will bring a more intense, deeply satisfying pleasure than all the delights this world can offer. Therefore, learn to endure a little suffering now so you will be able to escape a lot of suffering then. 

Before foolishly or carelessly subjecting yourself to suffering in the next life, find out how much suffering you can endure in this life so you have a sane idea of how much you can endure there. If you see that you cannot or simply do not want to bear much suffering in this life, how will you endure the torments of hell for eternity? If a little suffering now so easily stirs impatience and unhappiness, what will the fires of hell do to you then? The truth is, you cannot have two Paradises – one on earth followed by one in heaven. You cannot gratify yourself with the delights of this world and reign with Christ hereafter (Luke 16:19-31). 

Suppose your life was made up of receiving great honors and enjoying multiple pleasures, up to this moment? What would all this profit you if you died this very instant (Luke 12:15-21)?

Truly, all is vanity except to love God and serve Him only. For the one who loves God with all his heart does not fear death, or punishment, or the final judgment, or hell. Indeed, the love of God brings us into the presence of God (John 14:21-23; I John 4:15-18). And those who can call out “Abba Father” from a sincere heart, have their hearts assured by God’s Spirit that they are children of God (Romans 8:16-17). But we should not be surprised that the one who still delights in sin is afraid of death and the coming judgment. 

If love for God is not yet enough motivation to restrain you from doing what you know is wrong (sin), then it is wise to use the fear of God – and eternity in hell – to restrain you. For if the one who is deficient in his love for God sets aside or ignores the fear of God, he will lack the kind of motivation necessary to persevere in the pursuit of a pure heart and a holy life, and will soon fall into the snares of the devil. 

### Chapter 25

_On the zealous reformation and transformation of our life_

In living your life for God, be vigilant and diligent in applying the truth you know and the lessons you are learning. For personal encouragement and help with motivation, regularly review why you renounced the ways and things of this world (II Timothy 2:3-6, 15). Was it not that you might live wholly for God and become a godly, scripturally wise, spiritually mature, clean vessel who is useful to our Master (II Corinthians 5:14-15; II Timothy 2:20-21)? Therefore, remain faithful to your intentions by zealously and steadily pursuing your own spiritual growth. If you do, in due time you will receive the reward of your hard work, and you will gain freedom from both fear and sorrow (Revelation 21:3-4). 

Take the hard work of spiritual growth seriously now, and you will find wonderful rest and exceedingly great joy in the life hereafter. If you remain faithful and zealous in the pursuit of a pure heart and a holy life now, you can be certain God will faithfully and bountifully reward you (Psalm 18:20-24, 19:9-11; Proverbs 11:18; Matthew 10:41-42; Luke 6:35; Colossians 3:23-25; Hebrews 10:35-36; Revelation 22:12). 

It is your responsibility, as a Christian, to nurture the confidence that it is by God’s grace and strength that you gain the victory. Confident dependence on Him is vital to any progress in the Christ-like life (Philippians 2:13). But be careful not to become over confident about victory, lest you grow neglectful in doing your part (Philippians 2:12), or think more highly of yourself than you ought (Romans 12:16). 

A certain man, being filled with anxiety about the judgment to come and the life hereafter, was continually tossed between hope and fear. And coming to a particular day when he felt overwhelmed by despair, he threw himself down before God in prayer. While there, in meditation and prayer, he silently said to himself, “Oh, if I just knew for certain that I ought to persevere.” And soon he heard within him a voice from God, “And if you knew for certain, what would you do? Start doing now what you would do if you knew for certain, and you will have peace within and security with Me.” Being comforted and strengthened by God’s response, he immediately got up and committed himself to doing the will of God. His anxiety left him, and from that moment on he gave no more anxious thought to what would happen to him in the life to come. In place of worry, he filled his mind with the knowledge of God’s Word and the understanding of God’s will, so that he could begin to do and perfect all that God wanted him to do (every good work). 

Trust in the Lord, and do good, says the Prophet, so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed (Psalm 37:3 - KJV). 

There is one thing which holds back many from making measurable and commendable progress in the pursuit of a pure heart, a good conscience, and a holy life – the reluctance or even dread of having to do something difficult. They shrink away from the hard work of putting to death some interest or longing or pleasure or possession or position that they treasure more than God. And they back away from the grinding work of daily vigilance that is required to fight the good fight of faith (I Timothy 1:18-19, 6:11-12). 

Let no one deceive you about this, the ones who advance above all others in godliness are those who persevere in the daily hard work and vigilance required to conquer and put away those thoughts, fears, values, habits, desires, words, and behaviors which are grievous to God and contrary to holiness. Especially in relation to those sins that so easily entangle us, it is this kind of pursuit of God, this kind of overcoming the flesh, this kind of dying to self, this kind of hungering and thirsting after righteousness, this kind of submitting to God and resisting the devil and drawing near to God – all by the grace and empowerment of God – that brings the greatest help from God and produces the greatest spiritual growth (Ephesians 4:20-24; Romans 8:12-13; Matthew 5:6; James 4:7-8; I Peter 1:15).

We do not share all the same ungodly passions, unholy desires, evil habits, and selfish practices. Some of us are evil in this way and others are evil in that way. However, we all share the same Father, Savior, Holy Spirit, divine life within, scriptures, privilege of prayer, access to the Body of Christ, and process of sanctification. Therefore, the worst sinner among us who diligently presses on and resolutely perseveres in his pursuit of holiness experiences greater growth in godliness and attains greater spiritual benefits than the Christian who is by nature nicer, but less fervent and persistent in his pursuit of holiness. 

There are two things which are particularly useful for growth in godliness – an unwavering determination to put off completely that sin which we are most inclined to commit, and a zealous determination to put on Christ-likeness in that area where we are most lacking. In addition, it is wise to earnestly guard against and conquer those faults which frequently displease us in others.

Wherever or whenever you see or hear about a good example of godly living, observe all you can, learn all you can, and diligently apply what you learn. But when you see or hear of anything unworthy of a Christian, take note of it so that you do not do the same thing. If at any time you have done what you find sinful in others, deal with it as God would have all of us deal with our sin – confess it to God, apologize to those against whom you have sinned – making right whatever needs to be made right between you, and immediately return to doing what you know is right. 

You can be certain that just as you observe and evaluate others attitudes, words, and deeds, so others are observing and evaluating yours. 

Observing zealous and godly Christians living a modest (simple, unostentatious, humble), self-disciplined life is like smelling a most pleasing aroma and experiencing an uplifting encouragement (Matthew 5:3; II Corinthians 6:4-10; I Corinthians 9:24-27; I Timothy 4:7-8). In contrast, it is truly sad and heartbreaking to see Christians living undisciplined, immodest lives simply because they will not apply themselves to living a life worthy of their calling. It seems that such Christians do not care about the fact that neglecting a God-pleasing pursuit of holiness (on the one hand), and participating in activities which further distract them from the pursuit of holiness (on the other hand), is hurtful to the honor of God, the cause of God, the reputation of the Church, the spiritual health of the Church, and their own spiritual health. 

Keep fresh in your mind – through daily meditation, contemplation, scripture reading, and earnest, heartfelt prayer – the life of faith and holiness you have committed yourself to live. In the same way, keep the life, words, death and resurrection of Christ always present in your mind. You can know you are making worthy progress in this when, upon looking at Christ in these ways, you feel ashamed over the littleness of your efforts and the distance yet required to be fully conformed to His likeness, even though you have been a Christian for many years. 

The Christian who both trusts in God for the empowerment to be victorious, and deliberately and diligently does what is required of him to attain a holy life and a supreme love for our Lord, will abundantly find – in Christ – all the things that are necessary and profitable for life and godliness (I Peter 1:2-4). Indeed, he will find that everything needed is in Jesus, and Jesus is everything needed (Galatians 2:20, 6:14-15). Oh, if only Jesus fully occupied and owned our hearts, how quickly and completely we would learn all that we need to know to become all that we ought to be. 

The Christian who earnestly and zealously pursues godliness will accept and endure – with a grateful heart and a gracious attitude – all that God commands, brings into his life, and allows to enter his life. 

The Christian who is lukewarm – being casual or lax in his pursuit of holiness – chafes and complains in the face of trials and tribulations. Yet for him, trials and testings are often increased all the more because of God’s discipline. He has no consistent inward peace, because of his distrust of God and love of things he ought not to love. And whatever outward, earthly comforts he seeks, they are never enough to carry him through the next trial or difficult time with a thankful, peaceful heart. 

The one who is weak or careless in regard to self-discipline and pays little attention to the discipline of the Lord, exposes himself to much sorrow and the ruin of his spiritual life. The one who seeks an easier path to holiness – a path that requires less self-discipline and is less demanding than the narrow path established by God – will waver between unhappiness and distress because there will always be something or someone who displeases him. 

If no other spiritual duty were laid on us but to grow in godliness and to praise the Lord our God with our whole heart and voice, and if we never had the need to eat or drink or sleep, but could always – without interruption – praise God and devote ourselves to growing in godliness, we would be the happiest people. Indeed, being free from having to serve all the necessities of the flesh so as to give ourselves completely to the Lord would make us far happier than we are now. Oh that these necessities didn’t exist! If only all that was required for life was the spiritual refreshments of the soul – which sadly we taste too seldom. 
 
When a Christian gets to the place where he no longer seeks comfort from any created thing, he has come to that condition where he can begin to completely and perfectly treasure, enjoy, and delight in God. While in this condition, he will peacefully accept and be contented with whatever happens to him. He will neither rejoice over having an abundance nor be sorrowful over having too little, because he has completely and confidently placed himself and his well-being in God’s hands – who is his all in all. And whoever God holds in His hands will never be lost (perish or die) (Romans 1:36; I Corinthians 8:6). And whoever is in God’s hands, lives for Him and obeys His every word without delay. 

Never forget that death and judgment await each of us, and that wasted time can never be regained – it is lost forever. 

Without deliberate, diligent, daily study and meditation on the scriptures, daily dying to self, daily submitting to God, daily nurturing a mind that is like Christ’s, daily communing with God, along with wise, earnest, frequent prayer and vigilance in resisting the devil when tempted, you will never get to spiritual maturity. 

If you let your guard down and ease back on your pursuit of holiness so as to begin to grow cold, you will begin to experience trouble and difficulties. If you persevere in giving yourself zealously to the pursuit of God and godliness, you will experience a deeply satisfying inner peace, and you will find that the labor of pressing on to holiness is made easier through God’s endless supply of grace and strength, and your growing love of righteousness. 

The zealous and vigilant Christian is ready for all things. 

It is harder and more exhausting work to persistently resist outward temptations and inward sinful passions than to toil all day in the hot sun. 

If you do not take note of and put away small faults or sins, you will fall, little by little, into greater faults and sins. 

You can lay your head down on your pillow with joy and inward peace if you did everything that day for the glory of God and your own spiritual development.

Pay careful attention to what you desire, think, value, intend, feel, say, and do. 

Stir yourself up so as to motivate yourself toward godliness. Admonish yourself. Judge yourself as clearly and completely as you judge others. Be honest with yourself about your faults and failures. Use the language of the Bible to describe your faults and failures to God and to yourself. No matter what becomes of those around you – including those you have held in high esteem – never stop pursuing holiness of heart and godliness of life. Never neglect keeping careful watch over your own soul. 

The more violence you do to yourself in denying self and putting to death the old nature, the more you will profit spiritually and the more you will please God. Amen.
