### Chapter 1
_Introduction_

On the imitation of Christ, and on contempt of the world and all its vanities

“He that follows me shall not walk in darkness” (John 8:12). These are the words of Christ, and they teach us that we must imitate His life and character if we seek true illumination and deliverance from all blindness of heart. Therefore, may we make contemplating and meditating on the life of Jesus Christ our most earnest study.

Christ’s teaching surpasses all the teaching of the saints (holy men), and only those who have His Spirit find the hidden manna in His words (John 16:3; Revelations 2:17). Indeed, there are many who, though they often hear the Gospel (Christ’s words), feel very little hunger for it and gain very little benefit from it, because they do not have the Spirit of Christ.

If you desire to fully understand the words of Christ and how to wisely apply them, you must strive to conform your whole life to the teachings, mind, and likeness of Christ.

How does it profit you spiritually to have sufficient knowledge to participate in deep, theological discussions concerning the Holy Trinity if you lack humility, and as a result are displeasing to the Trinity? Do not be deceived, it is not spiritually sounding words that make you holy and pleasing to the Lord, but a godly life. Indeed, I would rather feel contrition (have a broken and contrite heart, a sense of shame, and fear of judgment) over sin than be skillful in explaining and expounding the holy scriptures.

Assuming you knew the whole Bible and were well versed in all the differing theologies, how would it profit you eternally if you did not have the love and grace of God emanating from your life (I Corinthians 13:2)? Vanity of vanities, all is futile and worthless, save to love God and to serve Him only (Ecclesiastes 1:2). Therefore, there is no wisdom greater then this – to turn our backs on the world and to reach forward to the heavenly kingdom.

It is vanity to seek after and to trust in the riches that shall perish. It is futile and worthless to covet the praise of men, and to pursue positions of importance. It is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh, or to be led by our feelings, for doing so only brings misery in the end. It is futile and worthless to desire a long life, and to have little care for a godly life. It is vanity to focus your attention on life here and now, and neglect preparing for the things which shall be hereafter. It is futile and worthless to love that which quickly passes away, and not to love and embrace those things that bring us into eternal joy.

Think often (meditate) on this saying, “The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing” (Ecclesiastes 1:8). Therefore, devote yourself to turning your heart away from the love of the things that are seen, and to set it upon the things that are not seen (Colossians 3:1-3). For those who follow after their own fleshly lusts defile the conscience and waste the grace of God.

### Chapter 2
_On thinking humbly of oneself_

There is naturally in everyone a desire for knowledge and understanding (Ecclesiastes 1:13), yet without a fear of God that compels you to live a godly life, knowledge remains spiritually unprofitable. Therefore, it is better to be a lowly peasant who fears and obeys God than a well educated theologian who proudly expounds on the scriptures yet fails to live up to what he knows. Such a person neglects to honestly evaluate himself according to the truth he knows.

The one who honestly evaluates himself is vile in his own sight, and he doesn’t allow the praises of men to deceive him into thinking otherwise.

If you know all there is to know in this world, yet do not love as God says to love, how will your knowledge help you before God, who is going to judge you according to your deeds? Therefore, run from an inordinate desire for knowledge, for such a pursuit leads to being distracted from what really matters, and it nurtures the disease of self-deception.

Those who have knowledge want to be seen as well educated, and they want to be respected for their wisdom. However, many of the things people gain knowledge of, are of little or no profit to their spiritual well-being. Therefore, to avoid being foolish, devote yourself to both gaining and applying the knowledge of things that promote your spiritual health.

Expounding on how much you know never permanently satisfies your longing for the praise of others any more than a good meal permanently satisfies hunger. However, a godly life brings inward peace, a calming contentment, and a renewal of your mind (Philippians 4:6-7; Romans 12:2). And a pure conscience gives you good reason to have great confidence when coming into the presence of God (Hebrews 10:19-22).

The greater and more thorough your knowledge of God and His word, the more severely you will be judged – unless you have applied what you know to your own life (Luke 12:48b). Therefore do not think highly of yourself because of any spiritual gift or theological education or Bible knowledge you may have, but rather fear the judgment of God for not having lived up to what you know.

If you think of yourself as knowing many things and understanding them well, know also that there are many more things which you do not know. Therefore, do not be haughty or even modestly proud of what you do know. Rather, be open, honest, and therefore humble concerning all you do not know (Romans 12:16).

It is foolish pride that prompts you to crave being seen as more knowledgeable than another. Such a craving is especially foolish and prideful since there are many who are more learned and more skilled in explaining the Scripture than you.

If you want to acquire the kind of knowledge and learning that is spiritually profitable, you must live up to what you know, you must love being unknown, and you must want to be counted as nothing.

When it comes to humility, you have learned the highest and most profitable lesson when you truly judge yourself less than others. To think of yourself as nothing – as having less importance than others, and to think always kindly and highly of others – this is godly wisdom and Christ-like perfection. Even if you see your neighbor sin openly or grievously, you ought not to think of yourself as better than he, for you do not know how long you can keep from sinning. All of us are weak and frail (Genesis 8:21). Therefore, with sincerity of mind, hold no one more weak and frail then yourself.

### Chapter 3
_On the knowledge of truth_

Happy is the man who is taught by Truth himself, not in parables and catchy phrases that are hard to define, but in a clear and straightforward manner (Psalm 94:12; Numbers 12:8). Sadly, left to our own opinions, feelings, and perceptions concerning God and His truth, we are easily led astray – discerning but little of the truth.

What does it profit to debate and discuss the hidden things and the mysteries of scripture when God will not even reprove us on Judgment Day for failing to know them? What foolishness, what senselessness to neglect the things which are clearly profitable and necessary for godliness while giving our minds to things which are curious and of little value, even if we gain a clear understanding of them! As the scripture says, such a person has eyes, but they cannot see (Psalm 115:5).

Have nothing to do with discussions about the origin of the world or other topics the scripture have already answered (Hebrews 11:3)! Those who read and believe the Eternal Word are free from such unfruitful speculation and conjecture. From this One Word are all things, and all things speak of Him. This is the Beginning which also speaks unto us (John 8:25).

Everyone who lacks faith in Jesus and fails to live according to His word, understands or rightly judges anything spiritual. However, the one who makes Christ his all in all, who brings all things to Christ, who sees all things in Christ, who lives according to the words of Christ, and who submits to the will of Christ – he is the one whose mind is kept in perfect peace and who is at rest in God.

Prayer: “O God, You are the Truth. Make me one with You in everlasting love. I am often wearied when I read and listen to many things. You and Your truth are all that I wish for and desire. Let all the Doctors of Divinity and Bible scholars hold their peace. Let all creation keep silence. You, alone, speak to me.”

The more a man is one with God in purity and simplicity, the more things and the deeper things of God’s he understands – and that without laboring over them because he receives the light of understanding from above (Psalm 119:97-100). When the spirit of a man is pure, sincere, and steadfast (faithful), it is not distracted from what matters most even though it has many duties to perform throughout the day. Why? Because it does all things to the honor of God and strives to be free from all thoughts of selfish self-seeking.

Where do the hindrances and annoyances come from that distract you from what matters most? Is it not your undisciplined heart? The man who hungers for righteousness and sincerely pursues godliness, prepares beforehand, within his own heart, to face the temptations and trials of the day. Therefore, he is not easily drawn away by the desires of his evil will. But having prepared in heart and mind for any attack, he remains faithful by submitting to God, resisting the devil, and drawing ever nearer to God through the use of godly thinking coming forth from a transformed mind (Romans 12:2).

Which Christian has a harder battle to fight than the one who strives to deny himself, to take up his cross day after day, and to exercise self-control over his flesh – all for the purpose of living a godly life and serving Jesus Christ (Luke 9:23-24; I Corinthians 9:24-27)? Yet in spite of the great difficulty and even weariness in battle, subduing our flesh and putting on Christ should be our unrelenting endeavor (Romans 13:12-14) so that our new nature will consistently grow stronger and our old nature will continue to dwindle and die. This is the narrow path to Christian maturity and spiritual perfection.

Keep in mind that all our perfection has some imperfection joined to it in this life, and all our power of sight is not without some darkness. Therefore, a humble view of yourself is a surer way to God than the deep searching of man's learning (Matthew 5:3). However, learning is not to be scorned, and the accumulation of knowledge about any good thing is not to be despised, for both are given to us by God. Yet a good conscience and a holy life are better than knowledge (II Timothy 2:19-20).

Sadly, because many seek knowledge while neglecting godly living, they go astray and bear little or no fruit. If only they would give the same diligence to rooting out their vices (their old nature) and planting virtue in their place (Christ-likeness) that they give to studying and debating spiritually useless questions. Then there would be far less evil behavior and stumbling-blocks among the believers, and churches would be more nearly as pure as they ought to be. Do not let anyone deceive you about this, at the Day of Judgment it will be demanded of you, not what you have read, but what you have done (Matthew 7:24-27; James 1:22-25); not how well you have spoken, but how holy you have lived (Matthew 15:7-9).

Tell me, where are all those popular speakers and teachers who spoke better than they lived? You knew them well while they were with you, and you listened attentively to what they said. Yet their pulpits are filled by others who probably never give them a second thought. While they lived they seemed to be important, but now no one speaks of them. Oh how quickly the glory of the world passes away! If only their knowledge and life, their words and deeds, had agreed together! Then they would have read and inquired and accumulated great knowledge for a good purpose.

Many perish through empty teaching in the church. We see the truth of this in that fact that many devote themselves far more to knowing the right theology and to Christian service than to holy living. And because they love to be noticed and considered important more than to be humble and holy, they "have become vain in their imaginations" (Romans 1:21).

The only one who is truly great is the one who loves God with all his heart, soul, mind, and strength, and who loves his neighbor as himself (Mark 12:29-31). The one who is truly important deems himself small, and counts the highest degrees of honor as nothing. The one who is truly wise counts all earthly things as dung that he may win Christ (Philippians 3:8). And the one who is truly learned is the one who does the will of God to the denial of his own will.

### Chapter 4
_On prudence in action_

When dealing with someone or talking about them with others, we must not trust every word that others speak, or the feelings we have within ourselves toward them (I John 4:1). Rather we ought to cautiously and patiently put their words and our feelings to the test to see how they measure up against the Word and will of God.

Sadly, we are so weak that we find it easier to believe evil and speak evil of others, rather than good. But those that are holy (godly in character, thought, word and deed) do not give unquestioning heed to every news-bearer, for they know man's weakness – that he is prone to evil and inconsistent communication.

This is great wisdom – not to speak or act hastily in response to what one person says about another, or to treat your assumptions and opinions as fact (Proverbs 18:13,17). A second part of this wisdom is not to believe every word you hear, nor to tell others all that you hear even though you believe it (Proverbs 17:9).

Take counsel with a man who is wise and of a good conscience (of godly character). Seek to be instructed by one better than yourself, rather than to follow your own ideas and strategies (Proverbs 12:15).

A holy life makes a man wise toward God and man, and gives him experience in many things (Proverbs 15:33). The more humble a man is in himself and the more obedient towards God, the wiser he will be – in all things, and the more he will experience that deep inner peace which comes from God.

### Chapter 5
_On the reading of Holy Scriptures_

It is Truth which we must look for in the Holy Scriptures, rather than cunning arguments with which to defeat those who disagree with our understanding of God’s Word (Romans 15:4). Indeed, all Scripture ought to be read with the same purpose for which it was written. [“All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.” (II Timothy 3:16-17)]. We must seek in Scripture that which is profitable for knowing God and living a holy life, rather than that which enables us to discuss its subtleties and mysteries. Do not be deceived, being able to “hold our own” when debating the scriptures or even to win useless religious discussions does not make us better Christians.

Therefore we ought to read the Scriptures more than any other book, and books about the scriptures more than any other source of reading material. Of the books that supplement our scripture reading – such as the Patristic writings (Church Fathers), commentaries, Bible dictionaries, theological works, study guides, and devotional works – we ought to read those that are simple and easy as well as those that are deep and difficult. Do not let the educational background of the writer be a stumbling-block, whether he has no degree or many degrees. Rather, let your love of the pure Truth and hunger to know God and His ways draw you to read. Do not select a book by the popularity of its author, but rather select it on the basis of his spiritual depth, his promotion of spiritual maturity, and the humility with which he presents it. Writers, teachers, theologians, and apologists pass away, but the truth of the Lord as revealed in the Holy Scriptures endures forever.

God speaks to us in various ways, without regard to who we are or what we know. You can miss what God is saying in the scriptures by allowing your curiosity over what is obscure to distract you from devoting time to what can be clearly understand. There is great wisdom in moving on to studying and pondering what you can understand rather than seek to answer every difficult question or come up with clever explanations for those hard to explain portions.

If you hope to profit by your reading, read humbly, simply, honestly, and with the intent of applying what you have not yet applied. Never read to gain the approval of others or to be held in esteem as one who is well educated in the Scriptures. Ask questions freely and listen in silence to the words of holy men. Do not be displeased at the hard sayings of those older and more spiritually mature than you, for their answers are not given without cause.

### Chapter 6
_On excessive and unrestrained affections_

When we desire anything inordinately (too much), we easily become dissatisfied with what we have and upset or even angry when we do not get what we want. This leads to the loss of contentment with God, and the loss of that deep inner peace which comes from trust in God.

The proud and the covetous are never at rest. However, those who are humble of heart and content with God, His provision, His protection, what He is doing, and what He is allowing, abide in that heavenly peace which surpasses all comprehension (Philippians 4:4-7).

Those who are not yet wholly dead to self in regard to fleshly and worldly desires, are easily tempted to self-pity, envy, frustration, and anger  – even by small and trivial matters. In fact, we weaken ourselves spiritually, thus making it hard to resist temptation and turn away from fleshly pleasures or worldly ways, when we allow our mind to dwell on unholy desires and ungodly thoughts (Philippians 4:8). And if in an effort to appear more spiritual we deny ourselves the desires of our flesh, we may look better on the outside but we won’t feel better on the inside until we put those desires to death – by the gracious enablement of God. In fact, we will feel sad, cheated, or even resentful over not being able to enjoy what we really want – which often leads to being easily angered when someone opposes what we want in another area.

And yet if we yield to temptation, our conscience will weigh us down with condemnation for having done what we know is wrong, and we will have pushed ourselves even further away from gaining the inward peace known by the godly. Indeed, true peace of heart is to be found in resisting earthly and fleshly passions, not in yielding to them. Therefore there is no peace in the heart of those who are fleshly, nor in those who give themselves up to worldly pleasures. True peace is found in the hearts of those who are fervent towards God, who treasure God, who trust in God for all their needs, and who live according to the will and word of God.

### Chapter 7
_On fleeing from vain hope and pride_

Vain – that which is futile and worthless – is the life of the one who puts his trust in men or in any created thing (Psalm 20:6-7, 33:16-19, 44:4-6; Isaiah 31:1; Jeremiah 17:5).

Do not be ashamed to be the servant of others for the love of Jesus Christ, nor to be viewed as poor or unimportant in this life.

Do not trust in your own power and ability, but nurture hope and confidence in God (Psalm 147:10-11). Do what God has given you to do – for He knows what you have the ability and power to do. As you obey Him, He will aid you.

Do not trust in your education or knowledge. Do not trust in the cleverness of anyone you know. Rather, trust in the favor of God, for He resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.

Do not boast in your riches if you have them, nor in your friends if they are powerful, but boast in God who is the giver of all good things. And in addition to giving you all good things, God longs to give you Himself.

Do not be conceited or boastful of your strength or beauty, for with only a slight sickness each will fail and wither away. Do not use your skillfulness or natural abilities to please yourself, lest you displease God who has given us every good gift which we have.

Do not count yourself better than others, lest possibly you appear worse in the sight of God, for He knows what is in man. Do not be proud of your good works, for God's judgments are of another sort than the judgments of man – and what pleases man is frequently displeasing to God.

If you have any good, believe that others have more – for in so doing you nurture humility. You do no harm to yourself by placing yourself below everyone else, but you do great harm to yourself by placing yourself above even one (James 4:6; I Peter 5:5). The inner peace of God is always with the humble, but the heart of the proud is agitated by envy and frequent irritation with others.

### Chapter 8
_On the danger of too much familiarity_

Do not expose your deepest thoughts and personal feelings to everyone. Reserve such revelations and discussions for when you are with those who are both wise and fear God. Do not spend a lot of time talking about these things with the young and with strangers.

Do not be a flatterer of the rich, nor eagerly seek to socialize with the great. Fellowship with the humble and the simple, the devout and the meek, and let your conversation be centered around things which edify. Do not get intimately involved with any woman, but commend all good women unto God. Choose God and His Son for your most intimate companions, and flee from seeking attention from those of like nature (mankind).

We must love all men, but not make close companions of all – for it is not easy to discern what is in a man’s heart. For example, sometimes we highly regard someone we scarcely know because another has spoken well of him. Yet those who know him well find him hard to deal with or unpleasant to live with, and hence do not regard him highly. Sometimes we try to impress others by our friendliness (get them to feel admiration and respect for us) only to displease or offend them as they discover the faults in our character by how we live day after day.

### Chapter 9
_On obedience and subjection_

It is truly an honorable, godly quality to live in cheerful obedience – to willingly submit to authority rather than be self-ruled. In relation to godliness, it is far safer to live in subjection – as one under authority – than to be in the place of authority. Many submit to those in authority from necessity rather than from love. Such as these are easily annoyed inwardly at being told what to do, or they openly complain over the smallest command. They will never gain freedom from their resentment and discontentment unless, for the love of God and from a humble heart, they willingly submit to those over them.

Though you search far and wide for an authority to whom you can cheerfully submit, you will not find that inner peace and contentment which comes from godly submission to whomever God has chosen or allowed to rule over you. The only way to find the inner peace of godly submission is to humbly and willingly submit to the authority who is currently over you. Thinking a change of location and hence a change of the one in authority will make all things well is a lie that has deceived many.

It is true that every one of us eagerly follows his own inclinations, beliefs, and feelings, and we like best those who agree with us. But if Christ is among us (that is, two or more are gathered in His name), then it is necessary that we sometimes yield up our own opinions for the sake of peace.

Who is so wise as to have perfect knowledge of all things? Therefore, do not trust in your own opinions to the extent that you are unwilling to consider the opinions of others.

Though your own opinion on a certain subject is good, yet if for the love of God you hold it silently and follow that of another, you will gain greater spiritual profit (personal growth and blessing from God).

It is often said that it is safer to listen and adhere to counsel, than to give it. It may also turn out that each opinion offered was worthy of serious consideration. Therefore, to refuse to listen to others when reason or occasion requires it, is a mark of pride or stubbornness.

### Chapter 10
_On the danger of too many words_

Avoid as far as you can unprofitable and unnecessary conversation. Talking about worldly things – though it be innocently undertaken – is a hindrance to godliness, because conversation that stimulates our fleshly nature ensnares and pollutes us by stirring ungodly thinking and feelings.

Many times I wish that I had held my peace, and had not entered into certain conversations. Why do we chit-chat, banter, and gossip, when afterwards – upon reflecting on what we said – it is obvious that we have fed our mind with unwholesome conversation, thus weakening both our conscience and our determination to persevere in the pursuit of godliness?

Sadly, we like conversations that require little mental effort because it is an easy and comfortable way to converse with anyone, and because it provides pleasing relief from the hard work of serious thinking. Furthermore, we are prone to talk and think about those things which we love or desire, or else about those things we most dislike. This too can be a distraction that works against a serious pursuit of God and godliness. And in the end, we are the losers – we are the ones who come away with less than we had spiritually before engaging in such conversations. For however good such talking makes us feel, it stands in the way of drawing nearer to God than we already are. It diminishes our love and devotion to God. It feeds our flesh. And it works against whatever desire we have to be further conformed to the likeness of Christ. Therefore, we must be on our guard and with frequent prayer that we do not waste time in this way. When the right and opportune time comes to speak, speak of things that edify.

Unchallenged bad habits and the neglect of preparing ourselves spiritually for each day leads to a weakened sensitivity and carelessness in guarding our lips. However, serious-minded conversations on spiritual things promote spiritual progress – especially where those of like mind and spirit make God and the things of God the basis of their fellowship.


### Chapter 11
_On seeking peace of mind and spiritual progress_

We could enjoy an abundance of peace if we would stop concerning ourselves with what others say and do, and with things that do not concern us.

How can those who concern themselves with or meddle in other people’s matters remain in a state of peace? How can those who pay too much attention to things outside themselves while paying little attention to what is going on inside, remain in a state of peace? Blessed are the single-minded – those focused on what really matters – for they shall live in abundant peace.

How is it that so many of the Saints were so spiritually mature, and so able to give themselves to thoughtful meditation and focused pondering of Divine things? Because they consistently and persistently made it their aim to die to all worldly desires. As a result they were able to free themselves of distractions as they focused their whole heart on God – contemplating and meditating on Him, His ways, and His Word.

Our problem is that we are too concerned with our own fleshly desires, whims, feelings, and perceived needs, and too anxious about temporary, passing things. Another weakness is that we rarely pursue godliness to the extent that we entirely conquer even a single fault. In addition, we lack the zeal, perseverance, and discipline required for daily growth in grace, faith, and holiness, and so we remain lukewarm and spiritually immature (Hebrews 5:11-14).

If we were vigilant and honest – moment by moment – in evaluating our spiritual condition (thoughts, desires, words, deeds) according to the Word of God and the life of Christ, and if we would put to death the lusts of our flesh and die to the attractions of the world, we would make obvious and worthy progress in working out our salvation (Philippians 2:12-13). Our greatest and most grievous stumbling-block is that we continue to cling to one or more fleshly desires and worldly affections. This pollution, this double-mindedness, this trying to love godliness and ungodliness at the same time weakens our zeal for holiness to the point that we will not make the effort necessary to walk the narrow path of the Saints. And when a little trouble comes our way, we further weaken our zeal for holiness by feeling sorry for ourselves, feeling disappointed with God, and running to the world for comfort.

If we would do the part God has given us to do in the pursuit of godliness, with courage and integrity , and if we would face the enemy with zeal and boldness, so as to stand firm in battle, we would see the Lord empowering us and helping us on to victory (Philippians 4:13). Indeed, the Lord is always ready to help those who do their part in striving against sin, and who trust in Him alone for the grace and strength necessary to be victorious (II Peter 1:2-11). In addition, He shows us and convicts us of our sin, thus giving us further opportunities to win more victories.

If we confine our progress in religion to outward observances and forms – changing our religious garb but not our heart – whatever zeal for true holiness we have will progressively weaken until it is gone. So let us lay the axe to the very root of our self-life so that we may be cleansed from fleshly desires and worldly affections, and in so doing grow in godliness and possess true peace with God. Surely, God is both able and willing to empower us for such a work.

If by the grace and power of God we put to death one fault each year and replaced it with Christ-likeness, we would make worthy progress toward Christian perfection. But sadly, the experience of many is that they were more zealous and holier after first becoming a Christian than after many years of being a Christian. Zeal and progress ought to increase day by day, yet it is all to common for Christians to think they have achieved something great if after many years they have been able to retain just a portion of the passion for God and zeal for godliness they had at first. If we would push ourselves and discipline ourselves for the purpose of growing in godliness from the start of our Christian life, then after a few years we would find that dying to self, pursuing holiness, and living for God would be much easier, more natural, and more enjoyable (I Timothy 4:7-8).

It is hard to break a habit. It is even harder to choose against your will or turn away from what you love or crave or treasure. If you are unwilling or too lazy to overcome small and easy obstacles (smaller sins and evil habits), where will you find the strength of heart and zeal to persevere in overcoming the greater ones?

Resist every temptation to exercise self-rule, and from the first moment of becoming a Christian, or at least from this day forward, begin breaking every evil habit, lest the failure to do so lead you little by little into worse evils. I am convinced that if you knew the extent of inner peace and satisfying communion with God that comes from a holy life, and if you cared about how much your willful or careless unholiness hurt God (Ezekiel 6:9), and if you had a godly concern for loving others as yourself, you would be as zealous and disciplined in the pursuit of spiritual growth as you could be.

### Chapter 12
_On the uses of adversity_

It is good that we sometimes face disappointments, troubles, trials, and tribulations, for they provide additional motivation to see ourselves as strangers and sojourners, and to live as those who do not put their trust in any worldly thing.

It is good that we sometimes experience opposition and disapproval, and face critical and unfair judgment when our intentions and deeds are good. Why? Because enduring these things in a godly manner promotes humility and discourages thinking more highly of ourselves than we ought (Romans 12:16; I Peter 3:8). Second, when others speak evil of us falsely and give us no credit for the good we have done, it can drive us all the more to make God our first and foremost source of security and approval. Indeed, we ought to make God our complete source of security and approval so that we do not feel the need to seek approval and praise – or even consolation when distressed – from those around us.

When the one who fears God is afflicted or tried or oppressed with evil thoughts, he realizes how much he needs God’s grace and strength – clearly seeing that without God’s help he is unable to continually do what he knows is right. Saddened by the wickedness of his heart, the weakness of his flesh, and the waywardness of his mind, he groans and cries out to God in prayer. Knowing he is trapped in this body of flesh, he looks forward to death so he can be free of his flesh and be with Christ – and hence become fully like Christ (I John 3:2).

Therefore, the recurring adversities without and afflictions within convince the godly that in this world there is no such thing as a trouble free life with perfect security and complete peace. The closest we can come to that is to live a life of faith in God and a life of holiness before God.

### Chapter 13
_On resisting temptation_

As long as we live in this world we will face troubles, trials, and temptation. We see this even in the life of Jesus, for at the end of His temptations in the wilderness the scripture says, “Now when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from [Jesus] until an opportune time” (Luke 4:13). Notice, the devil did not depart never to return, but to return at a later, more opportune time. Therefore, if Jesus was repeatedly tempted, we ought to be constantly on guard against trials and temptations, and vigilant in prayer, so that the devil cannot find an occasion to deceive us – for he never sleeps. He is constantly on the prowl seeking someone to devour (I Peter 5:8).

No one is so perfect in holiness and communion with God that he is no longer susceptible to temptation. Nor will we, in this life, ever be free from those occasions when our flesh or the world or the devil do their utmost to tempt us.

However, even though temptations are hard to resist and their frequent occurrence a burden to bear, they are very profitable to the godly. In experiencing them we are humbled. In resisting them we are spiritually strengthened and further purified. In enduring them we learn more about trusting God, the character of God, the ways of God, the Word of God, submitting to God, putting off the old nature, putting on the new nature, and the value of perseverance in the pursuit of godliness.

All who live godly in Christ Jesus have faced and endured many tribulations and temptations, and have received great spiritual profit as a result. On the other hand, those who continue to give in to temptation become increasing selfish and immoral in their behavior, weak in their faith, dull in their conscience, hardened in their heart, and in danger of falling away. Therefore, be strong in the Lord, for there is no home so godly, no work situation so Christian, no church position so sacred, and no spiritual retreat so secret, that it is without temptations and adversities (Ephesians 6:10).

No one is free from various temptations as long as he lives, because the propensity (inclination, desire) to sin is within us – having been born in this condition. When one temptation or trial passes, another comes – if not from the outside than from the inside (James 1:14). We will always suffer under this burden because the whole human race has fallen from God’s original state of perfection and has chosen to serve Satan and self instead of God (Genesis 3).

Many of those who have tried to be free of temptations by moving away from their current surroundings and circumstances fall more deeply after moving. Moving away, by itself, neither frees us from temptation nor empowers us to overcome temptation. What brings victory is (1) facing temptation with faith that God empowers us for victory, (2) with the power of the scriptures, (3) with adequate preparation and much prayer, (4) with self-control and endurance, (5) and with true humility (Hebrews 12:1-3; I Corinthians 10:13; II Timothy 2:22).

If your efforts to overcome temptation are confined to resisting when tempted, you will remain weak in those areas where you are easily tempted. And you will find that temptation returns quickly and frequently in those areas. Such a limited effort is of little benefit to your spiritual growth.

However, (1) if in the hours, days, and even weeks prior to being tempted you devote time to killing off and rooting out whatever it is in you that a particular temptation appeals to, (2) and if you devote sufficient time to putting on the character and values of Christ in that area, (3) and if you memorize scripture useful for following Christ’s example in resisting specific temptations and remaining on the narrow path, (4) and if you commune with God so often it is as if you are praying without ceasing, you will face temptation empowered and prepared to resist it and remain faithful to God.

Because killing off an area of your old nature and putting on Christ-likeness rarely happens in a moment of time, you will need endurance. Therefore, victory and newness of life are gained little by little, day after day, through patience and longsuffering, persistence and much prayer as you do your part in uprooting the evil in you and resisting when tempted. And though punishing your body, exercising self-discipline, and persevering in overcoming temptation is vital to gaining the victory, victory itself comes by the grace and strength of God. [God’s dealings with Israel in relation to taking the Promised Land provides an O.T. example of our sanctification, especially in terms of who does what and how long it will probably take (Exodus 23:27-30; Numbers 33:55-56; Deuteronomy 7:1-2; Joshua 23:11-13).]

When enduring a time of prolonged temptation, seek godly counsel. If others who are struggling in the face of temptation seek counsel from you, do not be harsh, heartless, or pitiless, but comfort, encourage, and strengthen them, just as you would want done to you.

Temptation gains a hold in us when we are double-minded, discontented, self-focused, and have doubts about God and His dealings with us (unbelief – Hebrews 3:12).

Just as a ship without a helm is tossed about by the waves, so the one who is careless in preparation and vigilance, and undisciplined in focus, is easily tempted in many things (Ephesians 6:11-18; II Peter 1:4-11).

As fire tests iron, so temptation tests the faith and character of the godly. We don’t always know the strength of our faith and character, but temptation reveals how strong we are.

Give careful attention to this truth: we must remain prepared and vigilant if we are to resist the devil and flee when attacked by the smaller, more socially acceptable or easily overlooked temptations. For if we do not resist the smaller temptations, it will not be long before we are giving in to the larger, more obvious temptations. In addition, it is far easier to resist the devil’s purposes and subdue our flesh in the smaller temptations than in the larger ones. Therefore, as soon as the smallest temptation knocks, we ought to meet it outside the door so that it has no opportunity to crack the door open and make way for more and greater evil to come in. It is for this reason that someone said:

>“Be on guard against the first, smallest,  
And more easily ignored temptations,  
For they are most easily cured.  
But if they are allowed to enter and find a home,  
In the face of greater temptation  
You will lack the strength to endure”

Temptation starts in the mind with a thought or simple suggestion. Next the mind imagines doing or possessing what is being suggested. This is followed by anticipation of the pleasure, fame, fortune or sense of security to be gained. Then with the desires inflamed, the craving for gratification drives consent (James 1:14-15). And so little by little the enemy enters in until he’s in altogether, because he was not resisted outside the door.

Here is a trustworthy statement: the longer you delay resisting the devil the weaker you grow and the stronger his influence grows within you until his temptations seem to strong to resist.

Some Christians experience their most severe temptations soon after conversion, some after years of being a serious minded, growing Christian. Some are sorely tested and tried the whole of their Christian life, while it seems others are only lightly tempted. Yet each is tempted according to the wisdom and love of our sovereign God, who knows the character and circumstances of each one and orders all things for the well-being of His elect (Romans 8:29).

Therefore, we ought never to despair or give in to discouragement when we are tempted. Rather, we ought to  pray to God more fervently that He will graciously help us in all our trials, testings, and tribulation. And help He will – for He never allows us to be tempted beyond our current ability to resist. And regardless of the nature or strength of the temptation, He always provides a way to escape so that we emerge victorious (I Corinthians 10:13). To this end the scriptures says: “Submit therefore to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw near to God and He will draw near to you” (James 4:7-8a). Let us therefore humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God and act according to His directives in the face of all temptation and trouble, for He will save and exalt those who are of a humble spirit.

Temptations and troubles show the strength of our faith, the quality of our character, and our progress made in being conformed to the image of Christ. In resisting them and remaining faithful to God, we gain greater eternal rewards. We display the depth of our love for God. And we show how much zeal we have for godliness.

It is not difficult, and therefore it is not exceptional, to be godly and zealous for righteousness when life is free of trials and affliction (Matthew 5:46). But if we patiently endure and remain faithful in times of adversity, we will make great spiritual progress and please our heavenly Father.

Some are kept safe from great temptations, but are overcome by those which are little and common. If this is your experience, then the lesson to be learned is not to trust in yourself in great things, seeing how weak you are in small things.
