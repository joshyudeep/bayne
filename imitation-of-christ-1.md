### Chapter 1 Introduction
On the imitation of Christ, and on contempt of the world and all its vanities

“He that follows me shall not walk in darkness” (John 8:12). These are the words of Christ, and they teach us that we must imitate His life and character if we seek true illumination and deliverance from all blindness of heart. Therefore, may we make contemplating and meditating on the life of Jesus Christ our most earnest study.

Christ’s teaching surpasses all the teaching of the saints (holy men), and only those who have His Spirit find the hidden manna in His words (John 16:3; Revelations 2:17). Indeed, there are many who, though they often hear the Gospel (Christ’s words), feel very little hunger for it and gain very little benefit from it, because they do not have the Spirit of Christ.

If you desire to fully understand the words of Christ and how to wisely apply them, you must strive to conform your whole life to the teachings, mind, and likeness of Christ.

How does it profit you spiritually to have sufficient knowledge to participate in deep, theological discussions concerning the Holy Trinity if you lack humility, and as a result are displeasing to the Trinity? Do not be deceived, it is not spiritually sounding words that make you holy and pleasing to the Lord, but a godly life. Indeed, I would rather feel contrition (have a broken and contrite heart, a sense of shame, and fear of judgment) over sin than be skillful in explaining and expounding the holy scriptures.

Assuming you knew the whole Bible and were well versed in all the differing theologies, how would it profit you eternally if you did not have the love and grace of God emanating from your life (I Corinthians 13:2)? Vanity of vanities, all is futile and worthless, save to love God and to serve Him only (Ecclesiastes 1:2). Therefore, there is no wisdom greater then this – to turn our backs on the world and to reach forward to the heavenly kingdom.

It is vanity to seek after and to trust in the riches that shall perish. It is futile and worthless to covet the praise of men, and to pursue positions of importance. It is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh, or to be led by our feelings, for doing so only brings misery in the end. It is futile and worthless to desire a long life, and to have little care for a godly life. It is vanity to focus your attention on life here and now, and neglect preparing for the things which shall be hereafter. It is futile and worthless to love that which quickly passes away, and not to love and embrace those things that bring us into eternal joy.

Think often (meditate) on this saying, “The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing” (Ecclesiastes 1:8). Therefore, devote yourself to turning your heart away from the love of the things that are seen, and to set it upon the things that are not seen (Colossians 3:1-3). For those who follow after their own fleshly lusts defile the conscience and waste the grace of God.

### Chapter 2 On thinking humbly of oneself

There is naturally in everyone a desire for knowledge and understanding (Ecclesiastes 1:13), yet without a fear of God that compels you to live a godly life, knowledge remains spiritually unprofitable. Therefore, it is better to be a lowly peasant who fears and obeys God than a well educated theologian who proudly expounds on the scriptures yet fails to live up to what he knows. Such a person neglects to honestly evaluate himself according to the truth he knows.

The one who honestly evaluates himself is vile in his own sight, and he doesn’t allow the praises of men to deceive him into thinking otherwise.

If you know all there is to know in this world, yet do not love as God says to love, how will your knowledge help you before God, who is going to judge you according to your deeds? Therefore, run from an inordinate desire for knowledge, for such a pursuit leads to being distracted from what really matters, and it nurtures the disease of self-deception.

Those who have knowledge want to be seen as well educated, and they want to be respected for their wisdom. However, many of the things people gain knowledge of, are of little or no profit to their spiritual well-being. Therefore, to avoid being foolish, devote yourself to both gaining and applying the knowledge of things that promote your spiritual health.

Expounding on how much you know never permanently satisfies your longing for the praise of others any more than a good meal permanently satisfies hunger. However, a godly life brings inward peace, a calming contentment, and a renewal of your mind (Philippians 4:6-7; Romans 12:2). And a pure conscience gives you good reason to have great confidence when coming into the presence of God (Hebrews 10:19-22).

The greater and more thorough your knowledge of God and His word, the more severely you will be judged – unless you have applied what you know to your own life (Luke 12:48b). Therefore do not think highly of yourself because of any spiritual gift or theological education or Bible knowledge you may have, but rather fear the judgment of God for not having lived up to what you know.

If you think of yourself as knowing many things and understanding them well, know also that there are many more things which you do not know. Therefore, do not be haughty or even modestly proud of what you do know. Rather, be open, honest, and therefore humble concerning all you do not know (Romans 12:16).

It is foolish pride that prompts you to crave being seen as more knowledgeable than another. Such a craving is especially foolish and prideful since there are many who are more learned and more skilled in explaining the Scripture than you.

If you want to acquire the kind of knowledge and learning that is spiritually profitable, you must live up to what you know, you must love being unknown, and you must want to be counted as nothing.

When it comes to humility, you have learned the highest and most profitable lesson when you truly judge yourself less than others. To think of yourself as nothing – as having less importance than others, and to think always kindly and highly of others – this is godly wisdom and Christ-like perfection. Even if you see your neighbor sin openly or grievously, you ought not to think of yourself as better than he, for you do not know how long you can keep from sinning. All of us are weak and frail (Genesis 8:21). Therefore, with sincerity of mind, hold no one more weak and frail then yourself.


### Chapter 3 On the knowledge of truth

Happy is the man who is taught by Truth himself, not in parables and catchy phrases that are hard to define, but in a clear and straightforward manner (Psalm 94:12; Numbers 12:8). Sadly, left to our own opinions, feelings, and perceptions concerning God and His truth, we are easily led astray – discerning but little of the truth.

What does it profit to debate and discuss the hidden things and the mysteries of scripture when God will not even reprove us on Judgment Day for failing to know them? What foolishness, what senselessness to neglect the things which are clearly profitable and necessary for godliness while giving our minds to things which are curious and of little value, even if we gain a clear understanding of them! As the scripture says, such a person has eyes, but they cannot see (Psalm 115:5).

Have nothing to do with discussions about the origin of the world or other topics the scripture have already answered (Hebrews 11:3)! Those who read and believe the Eternal Word are free from such unfruitful speculation and conjecture. From this One Word are all things, and all things speak of Him. This is the Beginning which also speaks unto us (John 8:25).

Everyone who lacks faith in Jesus and fails to live according to His word, understands or rightly judges anything spiritual. However, the one who makes Christ his all in all, who brings all things to Christ, who sees all things in Christ, who lives according to the words of Christ, and who submits to the will of Christ – he is the one whose mind is kept in perfect peace and who is at rest in God.

Prayer: “O God, You are the Truth. Make me one with You in everlasting love. I am often wearied when I read and listen to many things. You and Your truth are all that I wish for and desire. Let all the Doctors of Divinity and Bible scholars hold their peace. Let all creation keep silence. You, alone, speak to me.”

The more a man is one with God in purity and simplicity, the more things and the deeper things of God’s he understands – and that without laboring over them because he receives the light of understanding from above (Psalm 119:97-100). When the spirit of a man is pure, sincere, and steadfast (faithful), it is not distracted from what matters most even though it has many duties to perform throughout the day. Why? Because it does all things to the honor of God and strives to be free from all thoughts of selfish self-seeking.

Where do the hindrances and annoyances come from that distract you from what matters most? Is it not your undisciplined heart? The man who hungers for righteousness and sincerely pursues godliness, prepares beforehand, within his own heart, to face the temptations and trials of the day. Therefore, he is not easily drawn away by the desires of his evil will. But having prepared in heart and mind for any attack, he remains faithful by submitting to God, resisting the devil, and drawing ever nearer to God through the use of godly thinking coming forth from a transformed mind (Romans 12:2).

Which Christian has a harder battle to fight than the one who strives to deny himself, to take up his cross day after day, and to exercise self-control over his flesh – all for the purpose of living a godly life and serving Jesus Christ (Luke 9:23-24; I Corinthians 9:24-27)? Yet in spite of the great difficulty and even weariness in battle, subduing our flesh and putting on Christ should be our unrelenting endeavor (Romans 13:12-14) so that our new nature will consistently grow stronger and our old nature will continue to dwindle and die. This is the narrow path to Christian maturity and spiritual perfection.

Keep in mind that all our perfection has some imperfection joined to it in this life, and all our power of sight is not without some darkness. Therefore, a humble view of yourself is a surer way to God than the deep searching of man's learning (Matthew 5:3). However, learning is not to be scorned, and the accumulation of knowledge about any good thing is not to be despised, for both are given to us by God. Yet a good conscience and a holy life are better than knowledge (II Timothy 2:19-20).

Sadly, because many seek knowledge while neglecting godly living, they go astray and bear little or no fruit. If only they would give the same diligence to rooting out their vices (their old nature) and planting virtue in their place (Christ-likeness) that they give to studying and debating spiritually useless questions. Then there would be far less evil behavior and stumbling-blocks among the believers, and churches would be more nearly as pure as they ought to be. Do not let anyone deceive you about this, at the Day of Judgment it will be demanded of you, not what you have read, but what you have done (Matthew 7:24-27; James 1:22-25); not how well you have spoken, but how holy you have lived (Matthew 15:7-9).

Tell me, where are all those popular speakers and teachers who spoke better than they lived? You knew them well while they were with you, and you listened attentively to what they said. Yet their pulpits are filled by others who probably never give them a second thought. While they lived they seemed to be important, but now no one speaks of them. Oh how quickly the glory of the world passes away! If only their knowledge and life, their words and deeds, had agreed together! Then they would have read and inquired and accumulated great knowledge for a good purpose.

Many perish through empty teaching in the church. We see the truth of this in that fact that many devote themselves far more to knowing the right theology and to Christian service than to holy living. And because they love to be noticed and considered important more than to be humble and holy, they "have become vain in their imaginations" (Romans 1:21).

The only one who is truly great is the one who loves God with all his heart, soul, mind, and strength, and who loves his neighbor as himself (Mark 12:29-31). The one who is truly important deems himself small, and counts the highest degrees of honor as nothing. The one who is truly wise counts all earthly things as dung that he may win Christ (Philippians 3:8). And the one who is truly learned is the one who does the will of God to the denial of his own will.

### Chapter 4 On prudence in action

When dealing with someone or talking about them with others, we must not trust every word that others speak, or the feelings we have within ourselves toward them (I John 4:1). Rather we ought to cautiously and patiently put their words and our feelings to the test to see how they measure up against the Word and will of God.

Sadly, we are so weak that we find it easier to believe evil and speak evil of others, rather than good. But those that are holy (godly in character, thought, word and deed) do not give unquestioning heed to every news-bearer, for they know man's weakness – that he is prone to evil and inconsistent communication.

This is great wisdom – not to speak or act hastily in response to what one person says about another, or to treat your assumptions and opinions as fact (Proverbs 18:13,17). A second part of this wisdom is not to believe every word you hear, nor to tell others all that you hear even though you believe it (Proverbs 17:9).

Take counsel with a man who is wise and of a good conscience (of godly character). Seek to be instructed by one better than yourself, rather than to follow your own ideas and strategies (Proverbs 12:15).

A holy life makes a man wise toward God and man, and gives him experience in many things (Proverbs 15:33). The more humble a man is in himself and the more obedient towards God, the wiser he will be – in all things, and the more he will experience that deep inner peace which comes from God.
