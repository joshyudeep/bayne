### CHAPTER 1
On the imitation of Christ, and on contempt of the world and all its vanities

“He that follows me shall not walk in darkness” (John 8:12). These are the words of Christ, and they teach us that we must imitate His life and character if we seek true illumination and deliverance from all blindness of heart. Therefore, may we make contemplating and meditating on the life of Jesus Christ our most earnest study.

Christ’s teaching surpasses all the teaching of the saints (holy men), and only those who have His Spirit find the hidden manna in His words (John 16:3; Revelations 2:17). Indeed, there are many who, though they often hear the Gospel (Christ’s words), feel very little hunger for it and gain very little benefit from it, because they do not have the Spirit of Christ.

If you desire to fully understand the words of Christ and how to wisely apply them, you must strive to conform your whole life to the teachings, mind, and likeness of Christ.

How does it profit you spiritually to have sufficient knowledge to participate in deep, theological discussions concerning the Holy Trinity if you lack humility, and as a result are displeasing to the Trinity? Do not be deceived, it is not spiritually sounding words that make you holy and pleasing to the Lord, but a godly life. Indeed, I would rather feel contrition (have a broken and contrite heart, a sense of shame, and fear of judgment) over sin than be skillful in explaining and expounding the holy scriptures.

Assuming you knew the whole Bible and were well versed in all the differing theologies, how would it profit you eternally if you did not have the love and grace of God emanating from your life (I Corinthians 13:2)? Vanity of vanities, all is futile and worthless, save to love God and to serve Him only (Ecclesiastes 1:2). Therefore, there is no wisdom greater then this – to turn our backs on the world and to reach forward to the heavenly kingdom.

It is vanity to seek after and to trust in the riches that shall perish. It is futile and worthless to covet the praise of men, and to pursue positions of importance. It is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh, or to be led by our feelings, for doing so only brings misery in the end. It is futile and worthless to desire a long life, and to have little care for a godly life. It is vanity to focus your attention on life here and now, and neglect preparing for the things which shall be hereafter. It is futile and worthless to love that which quickly passes away, and not to love and embrace those things that bring us into eternal joy.

Think often (meditate) on this saying, “The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing” (Ecclesiastes 1:8). Therefore, devote yourself to turning your heart away from the love of the things that are seen, and to set it upon the things that are not seen (Colossians 3:1-3). For those who follow after their own fleshly lusts defile the conscience and waste the grace of God.
